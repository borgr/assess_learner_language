Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you could develop heart disease .
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with a certain genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On the one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing frightening effects in our family 's later lives .
When people around us know that we have got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether by caring for too much or keeping away from us .
And neither are what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the ''potential bomb' ' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways to help us control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes for the scope of the whole family .
For example , if exercising is helpful for potential family disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go to exercise .
And we can keep track of all family members health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members who have this disease .
Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .

Nothing is absolute right or wrong .
If certain that tests for genetic diseases are very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment known by others , it is OK to disclose the result .
Above all , life is more important than a secret .
Genetic risk does carry consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all , , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although the families have a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has knowledge of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual moral system .
The issue of right to know or not to know is highly debatable . Although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents : his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has knowledge about others ' profiles .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Does one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret from their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that he or she undergoes periodic healthchecks of their own .
Sometimes some family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from , the son or daughter for example , the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being 'allowed ' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received the genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information that they may not want to know .
Hence , there may be also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extends 'vertically' .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself , while the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are social constructs , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information , and to assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform relatives at risk or not greatly depends on personal morals and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
People with close blood relationships generally carry some similar genes .
In these cases , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue , and let others know about the risk . Subsequently , his/her family members would be able to perform some daily exercises to prevent the potential disease , or they might go to hospital and check for the corresponding flaws .
In my opinion , although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell his or her relatives , in order for them to be able to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Firstly , in opposition to announcing genetic risk ,
there are large numbers of patients with genetic risks who would want to keep it as a secret as it may indicate their high chance to carry certain disease .
In particular , for unmarried young people , if he/she is known to have some genetic risk , there may be uncertainties in whether his/her child would carry the same disease .
Therefore , to keep the information from to their future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause family members distress regarding this certain issue . Although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would develop some potential disease in the future , and therefore go to hospital for additional check-ups or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , creating unnecessary costs to the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of genetic risk would affect relationships with relatives as sometimes others may aim not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to contract the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent in terms of privacy , it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives .
Firstly , in the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell their spouse that they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings .
It is better to let the other party know the facts earlier , rather than after the baby is born and a genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease results from the inborn genes together with people 's daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk of diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candy and chocolate to prevent too much sugar intake . Similarly , if the carrier tells this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes , and then they can adopt similar approaches to lessen sugar intake to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may have diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers ' relatives outweighs the disadvantages .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and encourage prevention of the potential disease through daily exercises .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Genetic disorders may or may not be inherited hereditary diseases and it is sometimes hard to find out if one has these kinds of diseases .
It is a recurrent discussion about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is genetically caused .
From a legal perspective , the answer is no but from an ethical perspective , the answer should be yes .
We ca n't make a law to force a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem :
it is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , someone 's type of disease is personally private .
Privacy protection is a human right .
If a law requires someone to tell others his or her private details , particularly when one is not willing to do so ,
it violates his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
The law 's spirit also includes justice .
What is the basic difference between a genetic disorder and other disorders ?
It is unfair to release a law only relevant to genetic disorders .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law ;
a good law should be clear and easy to execute .
However , there are many problems with asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents , brothers and sisters , or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you suggest it is only necessary to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law , as
other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kinds of disease .
How can a law made by government omit such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from an ethical point of view .
To the carrier himself of herself , he or she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder .
By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with a bad gene may not necessarily contract those genetic diseases if they can live the corresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which makes it harder for the carrier to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertension .
They can build daily habits to eat less salt and fat and thus avoid hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n't push carriers of genetic problems to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives . However , he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem .
By doing so , less of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , many medical breakthroughs are possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available at one 's decision .
Testing can detect illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should inform his or her relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared with the family or relatives , and there might be chances for them to have it in their blood , they may adopt necessary precautions to prevent it .
However , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened by learning the knowledge about it .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion to keep it secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some have said that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as personal information which should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might dishearten his extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some have seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease as confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because they will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to implement some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on the kind of genetic diseases , contingent on the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is discovered in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in finding diseases at a earlier stage .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform the relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right of knowing their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it , and will continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of disease will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All-in-all , it depends on individuals and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , undertaken with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and influence the psychological thoughts of those who are impacted .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given regarding informing his/her relatives .
One should not be forced or obligated to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relatives should be made with the consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of a genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without consent from their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be put in considering the immediate family as oversights could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt with regard to their family pride or reputation resulting from the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder .
Also , this knowledge will help their relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about their outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it has been made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness , which will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment regarding the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
A person with a disorder , either mental or physical , can always easily be made aware of the disorder by his or her family .
When things come to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes , a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their relations reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , in the case that one of the family members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be aware as to whether the disorder in his or her body has a genetic risk or not .
Afterwards , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms manifest in a child , the parent will certainly be informed by the medics , then the whole family will stay alert to their body 's condition .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice as to whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that would be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Alternatively , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might also descend to his child in the future , his whole life will be a dilemma .
Of course , he or she will think of not having any children after marriage , and the same considerations applies to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family lineage continue stronger .
The reason behind this is that after WWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members reflected genetic disorder symptoms , he would have felt in an ethical dilemma for sure .
The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He had to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous , but with a potential genetic risk .
Thus , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and let the truth be buried forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about the consequences of telling relatives his or her genetic disorder .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to continue the family .
Regardless , if the disorder is rarely fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
One of the reasons why , is because as a carrier , he or she needs mental support to go through this situation .
It would be hard for an individual to deal with this issue on their own .
By telling his or her family , other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the stong bond with family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it would be better for the carrier to inform his or her family , as other family members might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves and it would be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform relatives , especially if it is contagious , as the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out in society .
For every action there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to burden her family .
I can understand the feelings of the carrier .
He or she does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen before the carrier decides to tell his or her family of his or her condition .
In conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feelings and I think that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything wrong happened in the carrier 's life without informing the family members , it could create huge regret in their lives if she leaves without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it , rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on her own .
In the end , I believe that the mental or even monetary support from family could help the carrier fight against the genetic disease .
True enough that there are lots of cancer patients who were given second chances to live as a normal person because they have a strong mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
As technology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual utilization of the techonology .
Genetic testing has been made possible : it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness . However , it could also make situations worse by revealing who the carrier is in the family .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives . I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that he or she has the right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier , but the carrier , before the test , can choose not to go and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty without the gene results and is willing to accept it , he could do that . That has been something that was 'normal ' to everyone in the past as genetic testing was not possible .
It could be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that testing is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled child do not have to give birth to a child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to be obligated to tell anyone , but has a responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemmas .
If the result turned out to be something that the carrier could not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true facts .
After realizing the he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family and create more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he still has no obligation to tell others .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and take appropriate action depending on the results .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilt can be more than expected , and could be a burden on their minds for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family would still stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years about whether a carrier for a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing . Yet whether the results should be communicated to others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic that is worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed , as family-related ethical dilemmas are involved .
In this essay , a few arguments will be pointed out in support of the view that any carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
We were crying hard but we were not alone , it 's our family and relatives that bring us up .
Hence , they should be the people we are grateful for and the people we would like to share joy with .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue , or to the extent of serious disorder , there may seem to be no point in sharing , but this involves more than just sharing of bad news .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform family and close relatives .
As the case of health issues are related to genetic risk ( with emphasis on " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation ) ,
I would agree with obligation for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives , in order to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be brought up in the future .
Although one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issues , or to bear it themselves , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives for a proper discussion for solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed in facing such disorder risk .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
It is for that reason that I would agree for obligation to tell the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and has plans for having children .
This would avoid the risk of more family-related ethical dilemma .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the argument to inform relatives once the results are known after the test has been conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
The benefits of doing so outweigh the disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at a crossroad of whether they should inform the relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is common law in society .
However , this leads to a new problem : " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
" This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still diversity in points of view among people .
Thus , I am going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this issue .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the following claim : " I will be anxious about my family if he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
Frequently , the carriers do not want to tell their families , instead they intend to continue their own life without the anxiety of families .
It is obvious that it would be better for one person to be worried , rather than many .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themself .
With their family 's support , there would be more energy to fight against the demon .
The demon is not easily defeated , and it requires much energy and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve yourself .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known gene is so serious that it can not be described .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
Lying on the bed for their remaining life , and even immediate death are consequences which we can not imagine .
Families are our dearest in our life .
Without their concern and support , we would struggle to survive until now .
They play an important role in our life which can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also critically affect our next generation .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the agreement of the carrier .
It is the ethics of staff in hospitals to keep the information of any patients confidential .
We can not blame them that they are connected to the undesired consequences .
However , hospitals can provide a counsellor to advise the carrier about the action that can be taken .
Therefore , these kind of circumstances will not happen again and again .
It is an approach that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special cases that are hard to be defined .
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
The carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest with the benefits of family or even society .
It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate choice , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future .
Due to the risk of having genetic disorder , many individuals have taken the decision to undergo genetic testing .
Because the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being a carrier of the same genetic risk .
Alternatively , they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In my point of view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , justified by the following reasons .
First of all , from the perspective of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis could be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their life , or may want to keep it as a secret and not allow others to know about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or pitied by others , neither of which are positive factors brought to their life .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult with .
If they do not want to think too much of it or view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
This ignores their own willingness , they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable .
Many people may argue that establishing the obligation may help more people who are the relatives of the carriers , with more opportunities to save their lives because of the early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological or social influence are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the unknown life . Partners , spouses and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .
On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants confirmation , and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of human rights , freedom of acceptance from relatives , as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the carriers ' choices and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
When a carrier of a genetic disorder knows the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma than getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and should share their problems regarding genetic disorder .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions : physically , by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited by offspring and , mentally , if those actions fail to prevent it being inherited .
Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented if the mother undergoes proper treatment and does not consume harmful substances during the pregnancy period .
The information for this may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives about her condition .
If more people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to create a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parent 's fault because there are always chances of the gene being inherited .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases are expensive for the treatment and medication , for example ,
albinism .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , the chances are high that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
To prevent the bigger problem happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care for your body .
If the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problems such as blood blocking .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can take their children to undergo genetic testing , and wo n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourthly , it is important for the parents to give a mental boost for their children with a genetic disorder .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
People and friends often mock conditions .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest relatives .
If family do not help then who else would be willing to do that ?
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepared mentally first , by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
In this modern world , technologies have improved a lot compared with the last century .
Particularly , in the medical field , there is great improvement in many treatments for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which is used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
The medical authorities claim that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is created .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this ,
because his or her relatives have the right to know .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be evident in the carrier 's relatives , that is , if one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder , other family members also have almost equal risk , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this reflect their rights ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James , about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what is likely to be happening to him .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having a similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders affecting their lives .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on their lives .
In addition , doctors usually quote that " prevention is better than cure " , which gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who aware of having such a disorder can prevent the disorder happening by adopting a healthy lifestyle , including a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder happening .
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades , medical advancement has increased exponentially , and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading , empowering doctors with advanced medical knowledge . Doctors are able to diagnose and provide genetic testing for patients , to help them prevent disease and take necessary steps to protect their life . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives becomes a challenging issue for both patient and doctor . In my opinion , I feel a strong urge to support obligation to inform the patient 's relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next-of-kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk . Accordingly , the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur . For example , if you are the only child in a family and you are unfortunately suffering from a genetic disease , then the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have child . Therefore , by letting your family members aware of the situation , it would lessen family stresses and suffering from forcing you to settle down and have children . However , social ethical issues like discrimination and privacy are the biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patient 's relatives . It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles . Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation to disclose information to relatives : it is the patient 's choice whether to disclose to their family members . Early disclosure to family members brings in positive reactions , and encourages prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie . She chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent . I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story : she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information , as in the case of Alzheimer 's patients,where it is the patient 's own choice to disclose information . However , research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret to who and how Alzheimer 's disease could be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( Dementia Today , 2012 ) . There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer 's patients , such as The Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association , 1980 ) . Athough there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving help and support from everyone , the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is the greatest help that patients need in their difficult time .
In conclusion , The State should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors as to what extent a doctor should opt to reveal the genetic disease to relatives , and in which situations it is open to the patient 's decision . In addition , The State could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid needy patients in encouraging them to open up for the benefit of themselves and family members . Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
Nowadays , the study in the field of genetics has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .
Not long ago , the human genome project , sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) , was started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , the technology was very developed already , and thus , an even more widespread topic arises .
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or not to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients who are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people .
To all of society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travellers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office , as well as passengers on the street , are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are , and put their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other without doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder , both as a social responsibility and a favor to preserve the family foundations .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' lives are no better than death .
Family members , as the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully overcome any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
A study of New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members around generally recovered 2-4 days faster than those cared for by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival was 30 % longer with family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may result in some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony .
While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situation , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater the bond that will be established between the family members , as well as developing a greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member truly believes in each other and loves each other , all these troubles are just tests to make them stronger .
Just as in the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , " what does n't kill you make you stronger " .
Being in Asian society where genetic testing is not common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
The courage to take the genetic test , and then to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have , may result in people being judgemental , while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) , since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases , and many of them will most likely judge , or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases , because they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird' .
This is because many people correspond genetic diseases to disorders such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or Down Syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as others , and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently .
Especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his , since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected . While I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a debate .
It may be that we can trust our immediate family members , but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's decision whether to tell the relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell his or her future partner about the potential risk , since his genetic risk may affect his children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any chilren because they may not be able to survive even after they are born .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore , although no one is obliged to tell their genetic risk to anyone , they should be encouraged to tell their future partner .
In conclusion as to whether or not a carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is the carrier 's because it is his own gene and he has the rights to privacy .
He may have different considerations , due to people judging or making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives . No matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected .
Genetic refers the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives should be informed that their children have a genetic risk .
One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with a genetic risk may not have the ability to work , or to expand the family with others , and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority of society .
They may not be able to enjoy what normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to care for their child if he/she is not able to care for himself/herself .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have additional heavy baggage , namely , medical fees .
Not only the child but the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can care for a new life that is not able to work and may suffer pain through their entire life .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for the good of the nation .
There are always newspaper reports that a new born baby has been abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby has diseases that need a huge amount of money for care .
In countries like Singapore they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled people such as medical subsidies , and building special schools to educate them .
Without increasing the number of disabled people in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways , like military or education improvements .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many abortions are conducted in hospital every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Many people may support the theory that every person has their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions .
However , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital every day , with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have be informed .
Also , human beings should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice , and
one should have full control of his/her information . It is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple are going to have children , they will run a few tests to see whether their child could have some genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
However , this is not the case I am discussing here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue for obligatory disclosure , is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
Therefore , they have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling relatives the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple tests .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having the related disease .
If a person has disease C , that might be as a result of gene A .
Therefore , he runs a test , and discovers that he has the gene AA .
This means both of his parents have gene A , and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. Alternatively , if he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
This means one of his parents has gene A , and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives ; if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that may occur if they disclosed their own genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that people might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives , he or she might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa , Aa is associated with a very serious disease,
then after he takes the test and is obligated to tell his relatives , everyone will know that he is a carrier .
Thus , all the married couples will run a test and know they are not carriers.They might then subconsiously see him as different , and worry that he would find a wife who carries this gene as well .
Thirdly , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , and one of the family members tests positive , who does he need to tell ?
If it is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships , so if person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows , and tells his wife D that he also needs to run a test because his nephew has this disease .
However , wife D is not even at risk of having this disease .
Consequently , wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week , half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and that his family might be a genetically risked family .
Therefore , nobody wants to marry person A , or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his/her information , especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose his information to is a potentially large group of relatives .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives
Nowadays , people not only pursue the comfort of their own life , but also better development for their following generations .
Since the technology of modern society has become so advanced , it has become possible for people to make the decision to take a genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation .
The debatable question and ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk .
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
There are two basic reasons :
the first is the importance of being responsible for your own wellbeing and health of your relatives , and the second is being responsible for future generations .
Your relatives and families ' awareness of your genetic risk is good for your own wellbeing and also , the health of your relatives .
If you are carrying that genetic risk , there is a great possibility that your relatives , such as parents or siblings , are carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone genetic testing , it could be just coincidence and fate for what may happen to both you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone testing and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly .
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting and even preventing getting the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also responsible for future generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to a baby , it will be possible for that child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Being the parent , you would be being irresponsible to your next generations if you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation whilst being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you can offer the option of whether to have child or not .
Even if you still decide to have the baby , because technology has become so advanced recently , it might then be possible in the future that gene alteration is honed and widely used , and you could then choose to give birth to babies and give them a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent ,
and in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing the genetic testing in the first place .
In conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and are aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations to tell your relatives and families the truth .
To tell or not to tell
Consider a case : we decide to undergo genetic testing , and we know the results .
We find that we actually are a genetic risk carrier .
Consequently , it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives , who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There are really a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we might make may have a huge impact on our relative 's whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health .
For example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease .
If we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it would be better for us to tell our family members , because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits , like eating less food containing sugar , and keeping a good mood .
It is important for young people :
the earlier we tell them , the earlier the better habits will arise for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing as well , to see whether they are a carrier or not which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue against why we would want to interfere with their lives .
Sometimes it is extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to know that they , or their descendants , may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable .
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes and tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future . What kind of feeling are you going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
We could become so anxious that we can not focus on anything .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so we are bringing trouble to them .
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make the correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem , and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby carrying this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell
Genetic testing is conducted when an individual is at risk of some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be disclosed to his or her relatives has caused extensive social controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects of the argument .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient , and make them aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass genes to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying genetic risk , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of the same disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes lives may even be saved if they are told early , and therefore conduct timely treatment .
So for the consideration of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease being passed to the next generation when people intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
They need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby .
Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , and some on the contrary .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in the newspaper years ago :
a couple in China had a son of 5 years old .
Their son unfortunately fell ill with a diagnosis of a kind of genetic disease which was very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder which can pass only to boys rather than girls .
Therefore , it was their son that inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife had actually already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she had not told her husband .
The son died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that .
If the wife had not hidden the truth and instead asked for the doctor 's advice before they had a baby , the tragedy would not have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , disclosure can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have , and they can perform treatment in time if possible .
Equally , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the problem of inherited disorder .
However , I think that genetic information is one 's personal privacy which should be protected by the law .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons as follows .
Firstly , the information concerning genetics is something personal , which is also a private like people 's bank card keys .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should set a law to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's genetic information is told to other people .
They may know the person 's potential disabilities , diseases or other naturally-occurring bad things .
They may set a bias on this person or even abandon him or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes , so they should not be thought of badly because of bad genes .
So I think whatever the genetics are , or whether the gene is matched with their parents , results should not be told to anyone , even his or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family , or even break the relationship between child and adult .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , meanwhile they feel happy with the accompany of the children .
The children rely the parent to live .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life .
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease in their genes after they have done a genetic test .
If there are no problems , that would be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any genes associated with disease .
Therefore , once people find they carry the genes associated with disease , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , and at least their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and have the same ancestors , and thus of course they have the same genes in some part .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy or afraid of .
If a person tells their relatives that he or she carries a gene associated with disease , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also have the same gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease occurring .
Also , they can prevent the disease passing to their children .
If the relatives carry that gene , the person can share the experience with him or her and give some help . Thus , they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she wants to get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries this gene associated with disease .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors .
Or else , if he holds back the knowledge of the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and this may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
There is a story I watched on TV .
A couple did not have a child for a long time after their marriage , their parents were anxious about it and asked them to go to hospital to check what the problem was .
After they came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a genetic disease , thus that they could not have a baby in their lifetime .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the discussion and decided to divorce her husband .
After she got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report : it showed that the woman carried the genetic disease instead of the man .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her , but that she had ruined her happiness .
Her tears meant nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the genes associated with disease which they were born with .
However , they can avoid the genes being inherited by their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying a gene associated with disease , they can make their family members bond closely , and also avoid many risks and conflicts .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect individuals at risk for a disorder .
However , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma , as to whether it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequences will be more significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Without knowledge they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and prepare emotionally .
Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing and the development of her risk of breast cancer .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look on the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within the family , because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
In addition , though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how can people face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation ?
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair .
It is just because you have not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you would feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever , and when it is revealed , it will be more shocking and upsetting .
As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , because telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy with each other , as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
Those relationships play an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should be obligated to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but it is necessary for the carriers and their family .
In addition , emotional preparation and the way in which you explain your genetic condition is also important , so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and , if necessary , to guide them if they wish to conduct similar genetic testing .
The Impact Of Social Media
Social media plays a vital , important role in our lives today .
It is almost imposible for us to keep away from it .
I became involved in Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived in Singapore .
Now I have over 500 friends on Facebook .
We know each others ' statuses and changes through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send an SMS to each individual any longer .
Instead , we will post and tag our friends to inform them of these kinds of changes .
If you are not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking by phone since it is free .
We discuss everything we like and we have more personal space . Our friends also get more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
Also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
In China , a lot of government organizations have opened blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on .
Social media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
Actually , lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people who are lost and so on .
With more convenient and human communications , the relationship between government and people get largely improved .
What 's more , varieties of cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can know more news and cultures through social media .
From this scope , social media has shortened our distance .
However , we get less chance and give less importance to talking face to face since social media is so convenient , advanced and interesting .
Even if we gather together , more people find they have less topics to talk about than before , and choose to delve into their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it as if we are in front of each other ; sometimes when we are by each other 's side , we seem to be further away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable as before .
Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxurious .
For myself , I long to visit some places after I see those beatiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I even can not sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our life patten so fast and leaves us less time to think about our life .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skills , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media has definitely had its turn ; but as with all good things , it is better to have in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
This improves connectivity between the users .
For example , one is able to send notifications and other information we used to have in hardcopy previously over the web , and the process takes seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime .
Next , communications are also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communication was done by one of many options such as telegram , snail mail or poor-quality voice calls .
With the welcoming of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase out most of the old communication methods .
Aside from hearing a voice , a webcam could also be introduced to emulate 'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is good practice not to intensively use social media all the time .
Intimate interaction is greatly lacking in social media interactions , particularly with regard to touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , where most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relations .
It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some have it , some do not .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance of utilising tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed .
Though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , and friends .
The types of use must also be taken note of : informing , interacting , discussing and other types .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use social media is justified .
For those who live within the community , they should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communication with each other .
At the same time , meeting up the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practices between individuals with realtime presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have closer connections with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contact among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
In the days without social networks , people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries that they had never met before .
Their number of people that they know may have only been limited to the people they meet in daily life , like classmates and working partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people and may give the chance to chat with people they have never known before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networking takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in daily life .
In this case , social networks help people to increase the frequency of talk .
For example , if a social network does not exist , the business people need to meet each other face to face , and it is time consuming . Even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot of time to travel which is a waste .
However , a social network helps people to meet and chat much more easily , they can even use video chat and create group chat to communicate with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants as it saves time and costs .
The social network may also create some negative impacts for people .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social networks and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life .
It not only affects the interpersonal skills , but is also bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public . As the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use other 's personal information for deception .
In conclusion , although the online environment is unsafe , spending too much time on the internet may be the potentially negative factor of using online social networks .
Social networks provide people with a more convenient contact environment , and improves the frequency of meeting with each others .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than negatives .
The world is increasingly becoming smaller by all kinds of social network websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who lives thousands of miles away eats for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages , by letting us communicate with friends cheaply and more conveniently .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you consider it as a platform to show off , and also as a stage for cyber crime .
Social network sites provide us many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends by phone , we can know his or her latest news by scanning a webpage .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can make people become closer as well .
For example , if you find out one of your friend 's favourite singers is Justin Bieber through Facebook , you can give him or her Justin Bieber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we may have lost contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as if we are living close to each other .
The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
Research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thoughts when he or she says or posts something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personalities by reading things that he or she puts on social network media .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on Facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health according to research .
The cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depend on cyber communication too much will not get used to the real life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationships in real life but only close cyber friends , one is possibly more likely to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others through our five senses .
With willing people wanting to become the best among others , social network sites have now become a place to show off .
Some people want to post their expensive things , or the overseas places of interest they have been on social networks , and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
It is mental unhealthy and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminals to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , a social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it , such as by putting less personal information on his or her Facebook page .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within contemporary society , and people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people , as they prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and disadvantages of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
There are about 50 % of the population who have learnt about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking , than time reading newpapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which has made access easier for consumers .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news published is reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This had caused panic among the people , who had then flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites , despite high security to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media is able to improve relationships and allow people to make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it would take a relatively long time to send the letter over .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other , as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , distribute information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement of which there are more to come in future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long distance communication and interaction due to accessibility and convenience .
With a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction .
With just a touch on any media/electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
Thus , long distance relationships or friendships can be maintained , and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
By sharing personal photos , posting statuses of one 's personal feelings or experiences , and the ability to reply to these posts , social media allows human interaction to be engaging and expanding with ease .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends , are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms .
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms . Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
Society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction is transformed into cyber interaction .
With the frequent usage and reliance of social media and the internet , a society that socialises virtually will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platforms to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically , as the media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain as to the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we receive through the internet .
We may in actual fact be communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real , but in reality it is a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agenda .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction .
Although emoticons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and their facial expression .
The danger of such media socialisation is therefore the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-up .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans results in the lack of confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news , and everyone can be the first witness of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artist or celebrity they love , and Facebook to see what their friends ' recent activity is .
Nevertheless , they still can use their phone to make normal calls and to write messages to contact .
It is not only phones that can do the things for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the internet .
It is obvious to see that the internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding how social media actually has some inevitable disadvantages for people .
People can only use electrical devices to access the internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer , and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feelings to people nearby , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face communicating .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
A family of four have dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because they 're holding and looking at their display screen with one hand , when the other hand is holding a fork .
A group of friends have high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk about without pressing on their display screen .
Children nowadays do not know what neighbourhood games are or who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduces face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and get lost eventually .
Firstly , they will lose the courage to meet strangers , then they may even lose the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in person , and not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do things , but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides its general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and to read the news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software , instead of making international calls which cost a lot for a normal family .
He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends on recent activity easily .
A guy who is going travelling for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save work most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways , but at the same time harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
All of us are living in the technological realm of society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology , which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we travelled by ship and now , we can use airplane to do so too .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we needed to post our letter and now , we can use e-mail ( which stands for electronic message ) to send messages to our friends , or even use our mobile phone to send our messages .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved ones is getting further apart .
Through the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies , or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the mediums that we need .
Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures , or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approach helps parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children have when they are overseas .
The social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved ones , even though you are separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned at the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among youngsters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habits to check their Facebook page as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concetrating when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This could then lead to stress , as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages of using social media sites . However , in this case , striking balance between social media and life is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of the social media platforms is commonplace in our lives .
In an increasingly globalised world , such platforms both enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individual 's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face real life , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they always have options to turn their back on the real-life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact with people in real-life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media , the more they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-term , and gone easily . Thus , they do not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using Facebook , because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay , particularly the links with people .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friend contacts that I want to keep .
However , the friendship on such a virtual world is so superficial , which is not relevant to real-life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it like a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly triggers privacy issues as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to information from the users .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to possible frauds .
Social media sites are at their peak at the moment . However , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real-life , they will not indulge in it as much as they do now .
The users will soon realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach to their friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or do we fall apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people , even the older generation , will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and in real time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter , and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends .
However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this , and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds , and in different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchange our contact numbers as well as Facebook account in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like Facebook is a great way for friends from different fields , or even from different parts of the world , to be connected .
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read his/her updates .
On another hand , we could update our profile by posting on our wall , and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
This allows friends that may not have the time for meeting up , to stay connected in a way .
Not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that breaks us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media , is the time reduction on face-to-face contact .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send a birthday greeting when Facebook promts us , " Today is someone 's birthday " .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send greetings cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year , and we felt so good to write one , and of course to receive one with stamps on it .
Gone are those times , and now we do mass sending , and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings , but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people use social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
They consist of functions of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages occurring due to social media , which are reflected in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
First , with the function of social media sites that connect people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers , without any time or place constraints .
Through social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over a thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travelling to the countries .
It saves a lot of money and time , as well as strengthening our relationships , although we stay in different places around the world .
Besides that , companies also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype , to facilitate the meeting of parties for projects around the world .
Substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits the company more , and boosts up the company 's profit .
However , there are always two sides to every story .
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces face-to-face connections between humans .
Since ancient times , human have interacted with others face-to-face .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
That is why facial interpretation is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , there is the point of view in society that " social media sites will affect writing skills " .
Based on a statistics report , more writing skills will be reduced when more time is used on social media sites .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device that we do not realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill of a person who expresses their own feelings and opinions .
'Privacy ' is a word that has been popular in these few decades .
Humans have their own rights to privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about social media sites leaking users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Everything we type on a social media site is recorded in the server , and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks like there are no laws , and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by the government laws , but also spied on by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology well , we should make an effort to not only balance the pros and cons , but also to lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for ours , and the next generation .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media , such as Facebook and Twitter , has become a main trend , as well as daily work nowadays .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to contact each other anytime and anywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media makes it possible to have interaction by writing comments .
When our phones are accidentally out of battery , we can also use social media to contact our friends .
Some people who try to talk in public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to have updates on friends ' statuses , and contact friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to rethink the influences brought about by social media .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people 's lives , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting , which has a time and place requirement .
People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation .
Secondly , people 's over-use may unavoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation . This kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from over-dependence of virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standards , as well as other show-off situations , may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social growing trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may continue for a long time .
Therefore , everytime we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media .
In the sophisticated era of the modern day , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportational borders are not a problem anymore , because communication and information technologies are enhanced continuously .
The telephone may be perceived as the biggest innovation created ever , when Graham Bell first introduced it .
However , since the internet has become familiar , the telephone has started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the users .
Let us take examples from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular addresses may change from time to time . However , on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using a name and a photo for example , as the identifier .
Facebook is like a combination of a messaging and chatting service , personal profile , media sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e .
social games ) . These allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter has a more simplified function compared to Facebook , and gives more benefits if used for information sharing .
Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences , in order to spread words quickly , so that only featured messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered : multiple photos and videos can be uploaded ; long notes can be published , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize beforehand .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say , but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth that may not be well arranged is a picture of your personality .
This skill requires practice , and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having dinner together in a restaurant , but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting pictures on Facebook , updating statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
This social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries , but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as a payoff .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that was mentioned before ; the skill can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadgets , not human beings .
Another disadvantage that affects people , is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build a " false image " in public .
We tend to only share our happy moments in the media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness , with no problems at all .
Other people are then influenced by us , and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think of theirselves poorly , which may lead to depression and mental disorder .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technology improves the life of many people .
In most countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
One of the advantages which is carried by those social media sites , is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , when social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
However , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter requires some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lived far away , especially in villages , took much time .
The appearance of social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People connecting through social media sites can spend no money on communication , and it also takes only one or a few seconds for the message to be delivered .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they have not seen for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them by phone or letter .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connections between us and our old friends .
Hence , social media sites serve as a platform for the connection .
Everything that comes with benefits will also have its disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for people and society .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people so reliant on them , that some of them prefer using those sites to contact each other , than talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought about by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other , and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to present their ideas well .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought about by the advancement of technology , and also learn to avoid the disadvantages , and maximize the benefits of those sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the demand to keep in-touch with people and the news has become tremendous .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing population of more than a billion users from all over the world , social media sites have clearly demonstrated success in playing an important part of our life .
However , there are arguments that social media brings in a reduction of face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users need is an internet connection and an email account , so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people in real life .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance , and brings people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all just a click away on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together , by allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world .
However , social media sites also have a second side of negative impact on humans .
Undeniably , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time socialising and interacting virtually .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook and Twitter , and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees spending their office time on personal leisure , rather than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings about bad impacts for us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the lesser time we spend on face-to-face interactions with one another .
Hence , it lessens valuable interaction between humans , and also time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occurring on both social media sites , that people use to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua which occurred recently on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to an unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has two-sides , and it depends on how we exploit them .
With current booming technology , it is accepted that people become more technology-savvy , and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites . However , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction , as it plays an even more important role in our life .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought about by these online chat rooms , tremendously outweighs their repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world far , far away without paying expensive airplane tickets , and sparing a one-week holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' , and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , or looking at their photos and statuses .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouths to each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online , when their masks of reality have been taken off .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 : 80 % of information posted online is true . .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality , while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes the genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent use of vulgarity or harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions , where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots that happened in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly , through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
These social media may be tools of their campaign to mainpulate the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas , compared to other traditional medias .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table , each have a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with their too many virtual friends , and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side , and teach them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online , and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to this social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible , and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication despite the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trade can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear , such as a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , and some fraudulent behaviour that can be done through social media .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are , and who their friends are etc. Superficially , it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives , in spite of distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , which is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account . For example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and will update its followers with headline news .
This shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without them needing to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started to do their business via these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook ; whether it is our friends who sell their products , or professional brands selling their products online , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites . This can be considered an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually , compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and many not be ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is through written language , and thus the 'tone ' of the message sent , and when it is received , may be different .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online , but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trust .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
Some people fake their identities on media sites , so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
In addition , privacy issues have become more common nowadays , since some people do not realize that they may actually be sharing some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider the drawbacks , and thus use it wisely , so that we can gain more of the benefits , and ensure it disadvantages us in the smallest way possible .
It is a common scene that almost everyone on public transport is watching a phone , or wearing an ear piece in modern society today .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human evolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others , even in different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as a loss of face-to-face communicating skills , which are important in the working place .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site , is that people can reach other easily , even without contact for a long time .
In this fast paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes , and they can be updated with new information from their friends .
Personally , I am studying overseas , and busy study life keeps me away from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends helps me know what their statuses are nowadays .
I am therefore able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy in work and separated from their children .
One of the managers in my workplace is in the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
Therefore , my manager did not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected by the same preferences .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing their information .
Students can exchange their experiences from studies , even when they are in different countries .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can appreciate the joy with them .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are a useful tool to help people get to know each other better .
However , social media is a double-sided sword , it also brings in some negative effects on our daily life .
One of the disadvantages of many people 's concerns , is that people lose the interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to impersonate themselves , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relationships even without the existence of the social media sites , we can not deny that it does affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , shadows always exist when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create , and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to use , bring people closer in this globalised world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends become real life friends , and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages of this change .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas and stories , and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
When we use Facebook and post pictures and statuses .
We are actively " presenting " fa ç ades of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , or statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking out attention , rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses , to see one of them which they might think is funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help to forge interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another , and caring for one another .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her Facebook page , where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions to another by texting some signs , such as = ) .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore , because I can easily read them from the statuses of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes , and he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her .
Information gets circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most , so I seldom miss it .
Social networking plays a role in providing , and also filtering information .
This saves a lot of time for me from reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I can become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with .
I also discover some of my friends ' interests , which I have in common , so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , what to say , each other , but rather , whatever is interesting , or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important , because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
These are advantages and disadvantages in themself . However , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure :
it is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
People that live in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media makes people able to connect with one another more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on social media sites , has become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered , that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with ones who lived far away from them in the past .
It could take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do , is just type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
People on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience , and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting , which can never be considered as a way of communication .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotion delivery , and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of abbreviations .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four letters such as " lol " ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which means as soon as possible ) .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
However , once they are communicating with people by face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a really big problem .
Social media also provides people huge amounts of information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore , like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their idols ' lives and works .
Updated news that people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops , almost every time at any time .
However , after one has registered on social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media site is honest .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you , in order to obtain your information against you .
The absence of a pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that is shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
It becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives , and makes people at risk of exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
How does social media help change our lives ?
With the development of technology , social media plays a more and more significant role in the whole world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it everyday to express their feelings or ideas , and a lot of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better .
However , it also raises concerns about whether it brings us more benefits , or a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , at the same time it reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
This is especially important to people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything that has happened in their home country , and the method which they can show their lives to their loved ones as well .
What 's more , these days , social media plays an important role in spreading information .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their information on their Facebook account , and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world , which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for those young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world , than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great amount of people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the bad effects on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
They pointed out that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see at some party , that people would prefer to look at their phones and read all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry , if all the teenagers continue to use social media frequently , they will decrease in the ability to talk to people .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate about with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes a lot of time as well .
Think in another way , if we put that time we spend on wandering those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our family or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use it wisely , no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media
Nowadays , as technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are appearing in our daily life .
You can see people using Facebook and Twitter through their smart phones or ipads , on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the appearance of this modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
Firstly , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago when these modern products were not popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way was still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
Some would take a long time and some were not efficient enough for people to get a response .
However , social media solves these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
The communication is also not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emoticons .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations , see the comments online , and share their opinions on these websites .
Social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provides a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's life .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face , such that their interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time on it and forget their real life .
Actually , I have seen some people be very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they behave quite boringly when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on social media , it may cause some problems with their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
Some may share less and less time with their family , and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some inappropriate values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the prevalence of social media sites is a double edged sword .
It can make our life simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through this social media .
Alternatively , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life , and negatively affect their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages .
So we need to make best use of this social media , and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
We should remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know their friends ' recent looks and interesting things that have happened to those people , just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that the social media sites truly ensure that old friends do not lose information , and gives them the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country .
However , the social media sites truly reduce face-to-face communication , which affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in people 's daily life .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely .
By typing words and showing pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers , so instead they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely , but
people can also know much information about celebrities on Twitter and Facebook , such as Obama and Bill Gates to get first-hand study materials on them .
They can learn how these people succeed , and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous peoples ' thoughts by using social media .
Similarly , with the help of social media , some homeless people , or someone who needs the money to cure a disease can get help from the world quickly , because once one person knows the information , he or she will share it to their " friends ' area " , then many people will know about it , and spread the information to the people who can give help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the popularity of the social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking .
People may even prefer to talk to their friends and meet their friends online , and then gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Therefore , social media truly limits the interpersonal skills , such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relationship between him and his friends .
Secondly , without true communication in real life , people lose the ability to see truth or lies .
There are many people using social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages . However , in real life , he or she may not have a job or may live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and be easily cheated , or even lose money , even if they 're safe .
Therefore , social media is not safe , which is bad for teenager 's future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , there exists some disadvantages which will affect people to some degree .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society
Nowadays , with the development of technology in society , social media has become more popular , and even important in our daily life .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook and microblogs more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their home to interact with others : they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done , or narrate funny stories .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others through social media , but problems come out .
People do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially strangers .
Therefore , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : convenience to contact others , and ease of knowledge about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In previous years , if one wanted to tell some important news to another person who lived far away , he needed to write letters and it wasted time .
The long distance and time-consumption made spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people might not contact distant friends and relatives unless there was something important .
However , people now can contact anyone all over the world who can use a computer at any time , and there is no time delay for messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media .
If there was no social media , it would be difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members .
And the information collected may not be intact or true .
Today , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want , just by searching online , and then know about what that person did everyday , and at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , they include : wasting time , causing illness related to sitting a long time at the computer , quick-spread of rumours and fake news , and most importantly , making people lose the ability to talk to others face to face confidently .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk to each other .
If there is a joke on their Facebook page , they may talk to others in this way , " Hi , look how ridiculous this is " , then they laugh together .
No matter if it is a party , dinner or just simply a get-together , there are always some people bowing their heads , and playing their phones , even if their family and friends are in front of them .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media , whilst being aware of the disadvantages of it , and trying their best to avoid the disadvantages happening to them and their friends and family .
Today 's world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networking can affect interpersonal skills , as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages in the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures or languages .
Social media is a trending channel , and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
There are no more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , social media networks open the door of opportunities for people , due to their great benefit of connecting people .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends , and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In business areas , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also has disadvantages which have created worries to society recently , and made social networks a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to live in a social media world most of their time , and have reduced face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the media world is not trustworthy or real .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who lived in the social media world every night , for eight years .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusted them and shared her life with them .
Then eventually , she discovered that the eight people were one , as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crime and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family , friends , and banks , to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites , and reject chances to be exposed to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
Recent research has shown that the more time people spend on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
As a result , if the situation keeps continuing in this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the young generation .
To put it in a nutshell , everything has pros and cons , and
so does social media .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing business , but it also can damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way , with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interactions , to develop people 's potential to the fullest .
