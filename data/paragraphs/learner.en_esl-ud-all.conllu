I can go on  internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones.
I was doing different activities  from designering flier to selling tickets.
For example, for our jobs  supecial ceremonys  and so on.
Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you appreciate is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.
Anyway, the most important thing was that I had  good experience.
When I was in highschool I used to be a member of the campfire.
After that it suggested  to visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed!
I knew I could not do any moviment for my safety but I did and for my surprise It  run away.

I'm very happy to receive some news about you.
But it  happenned the opposite.
To conclude, although you can have good moments while shopping all of us know that it is not always enjoyable, isn't it?
At home, there are less rules.
Especially, students are free!
we would suggest just on Tuesday afternoon no doing shop,  everything else could stay the same.
Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts  available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price written in the advertisement.
Finally, I would like to ask you to give some money back to me.
Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in a shopping centre , that you can't move yourself forwards or backwards.

Moreover, I bought a Â£20 ticket without any discount even the advertisement mentioned  discount is available.
I am writing to explain some aspects about your show.
The old man and woman tried to keep her staying  their house, but they couldn't.

Then, even if we could enter in the room, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expects.
Also in the advertisement  says , that the show will begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15; that mean that I have to cancelled a date that I had at 21:00, because I coudn't make it.

I suppose you know about  "Portugal Pop Concert" that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month, aren't you?

To sum up, although there is certainly a good side of shopping, such as  pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for  long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.

However, we promised our perents to make  cleaning up every week.
Of course I will give you some more detail about the student conference.

So I decided to write you this letter to note that wrong informations and to ask for the restitution of the price of  ticket or a part of that.
From my point of view, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin.
You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation.

We have thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformation in nowdays in England about fashions, Leisure, sports and style of life.
In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card.
 quality of life  very low.
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven world wonders, I knew , I had to see it.
The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual  activity all over the house.
Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing  could ever happened in their lives.
And please could you give me  details about how does the weather  like there and what type the clothes will I have to bringh?
If no, what do you sugest?
So I would like to choose these two activities while I am at the Camp.
But I enjoy discovering  new activities!
On top of everything, the main cast, Danny Brook, did not appear on the show.
I had a week holiday in London, so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure, however it was the worse evening in my life.
Countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate.
On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us  support to our hard tasks and letting us free to apply our attention and efforts to more important things.
Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough place for everyone and you could not enjoy anything!
I think that this kind of people have a poor life because they never can be quiet because all the poeple know them and want to know a lot of things about them.
As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do, but I dicided to take swimming and photography, because I am very good at swimming and because currently I am attending a photography course in Vienna.
After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitted clothes  taking off and putting on.
Contrary to the advertisment everything was disapointing.
Just imagine the way of future people's life .
It began 45 minutes later than it should have been.
In my  countries school we are not allowed to have an argument with class-mates and  not allowed to eat at class.
Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me to take.
Besides, I really would like to know , approxiametely how much money should I take with me ?
Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her  class mate and she run away as fast as she could.
I'd rather sleep in  tents because I want to enjoy this wild experience!
And the  restorant of the theatre was being  pait, so I could not go  as you said in the advertisment.
So that's why they have invented a telephon.
At that point, even if there had been Danny Brook as the advertisement announced, it wouldn't have been a less disappointing evening.
I am sure you can take attention on this.
Last of all, it said in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant  after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was redecorating and no annocement was made.
Finally, I am considering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need.
About the acommodation, out of the two possibilities, I choose sleeping in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
Firstly, I expected to see the play by Danny Brook  who is my favourite actor.
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximetively one mile away.
It's connected with our house, our workplace and e.t.c.
On the tale "It's a good life", the author gives much more emphasis to the Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story.

The first thing that  dissapoint me was the starring.
So I was suspended, I had a fight with one of my best friend, all because she wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
After having thought about this video and asked different people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take  a great part in a day at school; this being in three parts.
I've asked my mom and my friends and everybody didn't know where it was.
WELL, THE TWO ACTIVITIES THAT I WOULD  TO CHOOSE ARE BASKETBALL AND SINGING.
Thank you in advanced for your  comprehention and we look forward to hearing for you.
if we used , we would be sent to the head office of the school.
Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before , that enjoying yourself like this , could be weirdly.
It also makes me write to my friends by e-mail.
And is it better to have change or checks?
I couldn't write  you because I was very busy.
I can hardly await your reply!
AFTER THE MEETING WE RECIEVED ALL THE SAME CLOTHES.
I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in  log cabins.
, What is your name, house, dog, cat, boy, girls etc , I am very happy that I promed to myself  learn spanish this sommar at the Huntingdon College.
At first my favourite actor Danny Brook didn't perform  without any explictions , and the show should started at 19:30 instead of 20:15!!
I can't stand wearing a suit or kit like  which has been showed in Starwars!
In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things  like sport, reading, chating about ideas which make our lives better.
I can play well basketball, because I use to  practice basketball, when I go to the club every Saturday.
Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them.
However, the technology never stops, we always search  new things because we are made to compete, discover, think  things which we don't know.
I had gone to the show which according to the advertisement was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15.
Now I will give you the informations which you asked for.
You should back my money immedeastry because that night was far from parfect.
First of al, in my opinion, TV has a great education functions, and  also makes the world become small.
this lesson techer you how to organise what you want to write.
First time, when I saw the advertisement on the newspaper, I really appreciated .
In the addition  when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films .
But after all the party was great.
In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is  wasting  time.
After entering  you will see the signed conference room.
Firstly, I would like to inform  that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another month.
Personally, I do think televisions is the most important invention.

" Um very unpleased that I have to write you this letter.

When shopping, we don't need to wait  the Kasse to take every article's note by hand.
In the big room where we'll have the party, it'll be some picturs of our college ,
In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become nervous because I can't find anything.
Even if the photograph made are modest work, I am really interested in this activity.
We had been told that discounts to the ticket-prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered.
I WAS PART OF THE STAFF ,
Why is it every thing that  on the canidates were wrong and different  what we had.
First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own private life, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and a family member's or the closest friend's death.
And also, it  was written that the discounts were available but they were not.
Last weekend, I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show "over the Rainbow".
To begin my complains I can start with the actor -  was a different one , not Danny Brook.
As soon as the arrangement for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend.
So I think you'd better to wear a dress.
In conclusion, don't forget that a job is just spent in your "spare" time.
Which kind of clothes have I to put in my case?
I am writing to you to give  some requiered information.
That's why I'd like to feel adventurally.
Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: "I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do 
Thank you for the letter that conformed first prize.
You'll be agree with me that 45 minutes to waiting for the starting of the show is a too long time.
About accomodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in  tents as I believe  is the right type of accomodation for going camping ?
It means on  second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning  untill 19.00.
Therefor I wouldn't change anything in my home life and neither in my school life.
Technology brings  me a lot of new possibilities every day, and it also makes everything easier.
The technology is the future, and the present.
I also would like to remark that this change does not increment the cost of the trip, because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students.
My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect "dangerous" items , I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches in the bags.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE HEARING FROM YOU SOON.
Finally, I give you some suggestions which could spend for about 3 hours in the national museum in my area.
Machines, such as a dish washer, laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary.
First of al, I want to thank you for the interesting programme , which you already have organised.
Suddenly, she heart a  men voice called her  "Sara...Sara.. look down to the river."
If you are used to go to the Shopping very often, maybe  is because you don't know about all the others good things you can do on your weekend.
The uniform , we are wearing has to be perfect.
Firstly, the actors were different from the ones written in the advertisement  which was very disappointing for me.
First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation .
After all this, I want to know if I will have some money back.
Another bad thing is that people want something very badly, and they can't afford it.
We would like our money back  please  because every thing gone wrong , the atmosphere totally chanced!
I was so exited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band .
First of all, the performers should be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
You should be punctual when coming to  dining table, respectful, do your  home works and watch TV less and not too loud.
If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher.
We would be very interesting in seeing the english fashion.
If you leave the bus, the conference is in the house opposite the road.
However, I have been asked by the class to propose   you another visit.
And thanks again for offer me two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood.
She spent this  only for a magazin.
I helped  setting up the sound equipment, programming the light system on the computer,  tidy up Madonna's room!
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows in the "Circle Theatre".
Firstly, the material of which clothes are made has  a wide range.
Because , althoug they are famous they have also their private life.
After the show I went  the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed.
Thank you for your letter, like usual, it's a pleisure to receive a word from you.
The advertisement outside the theatre explained a lot of interesting things to enjoy.
In the advertisement, you mentioned actors, time, price discount and equipment.
If you need any  information, please let me know.
However, it  closed because it was being decorated.
I also helped to serve people who would like drink ,
Would you give me some pocket-money during the trip .
i whant to know some questions about it.
I phoned to  police And told  the whole story.
I prefer to stay in log cabins  than in tentes, because log cabins has much esctructure, that I need to stay for a few days.
The dance shows made  sight for our sour eyes ,
At the end all depends in our attitud to life, including shopping.
Molly, Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good-bye to each other as, to Molly, they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they have been dating, she wanted them to enjoy their own time .
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NEW YOUR HOUSE?
I hope that  after  jully won't disturb the Camp California's plans for me.
Functions' clothes are the way to love animals!
We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life.
 Internet is very handy, you can buy, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, that is really funny.
Every one hopes to enjoying himself and comes back with a lot of knowledge.
So we suggest  to put it this way on Tuesday 14 , in the morning go to the Science Museum and  instead of shopping, we could attend the London Fashion show, because  will be the latest fashion, leisure   and sports wear, make up, and hair styles, and as you know us, we love all those topics, and it's a great opportunity while we are  London.
I learned swimming at my age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming.
Then, we have to be as best secret keepers as possible, or we will end  like Ali and Pat.
The church is located on a place where you  see the whole mountain chain of Rigi.
If you're tire, the pill can give you vitamin, protein and make you refresh
I have just received your letter telling me I have won the first prize in your competition, and I am glad for it.
I would like to know which sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary.
Another point is  now you don't need to go out just for shopping.
I spent two days at the International Arts Festival you have organized.
When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor.
Plays and films qualities were good, but quantities were bad.
About accomodation I would prefer  cabins, because I suffer   alergic, and I think  tend , would be not very suitable for my health.
I'm writting  you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on your theatre.
We can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up, and hairstyles which we will learn  next term.
The two activities that I prefer will be Basketball, because I had the experience to play in my school's big for almoust a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I   practice since I was ten.
I believe there are  lot of why to enjoy shopping.
The restaurant was closed because there wasn't  electricity 
In August, I have already made another appointment with my friends.
They look like a robotes who have to do their duties - to buy.
I'm used to be the photographer at the holidays with my family and I know how a camera works.
In fact, I did.
I can't believe she said that , I was at the Maria's party and  'cause of my distraction, I said Pat that I had lost the Jon's shirt.
That show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00.
First off all I'll prefer to travel in July, because it is the only month I have free.
The only effect on me is more often disagreements with my parents.
I would also like to thank you for the good programme you made for us,  especially the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating.
Recently, I had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to your theatre to see "Over The Rainbow" and I was really disillusioned.
Peter got very angry and told Pat why  did they say that to him.
Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to express my suggestion and recommendations.
We have had a quite pleasant time except  the evening.
And we have two choices to get to the conference, a bus or a train.
A few days before, I had founded a little window at the back of the building. so I entered by this way and by chance I just arrived in the   monney's room.
Pat and Ted , had always competition, and Ted used to be the best , he never had failed and people in general  constums to like more Ted , I don't now why.
My wife and me went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook.
I would like to stay in  log cabins because I have bad  experiens about tents.
This is very nice when you can do your shopping like that.
Everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others.
I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement.
In addition to this  some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there fro the occasion and, personally speaking   the show could be done at the open air next year, so that  music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around.
Thank you for your letter of asking for my help to the conference.
However, it would not have been such a great problem if the show on the proved to be as good as they promised but it really was not worth seeing, especially because the first actor was not Danny Brook  as we expected  but an unknown, clearly an inexperienced young actor, named Tom Douglas.
I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held  21st and 22nd November.
( that wasn't easy to decide which activities I will do, cause almost  choice interested me)
i'd prefer take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting spend nights in the tent.
Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing.
I was pleased as I got it.
But the best thing that we do, when we make  shopp is spend the time having lunch at  snack bar, watching cinema and play games computer.
One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually.
It must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character.
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing .
To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars or politicians have a right for it.
You will can't believe how many famous people I  known.
I kept asking myself ' should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him.
I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays   this month since last January.
For example, put the music  too  hight when my syster is working.
I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to  practice new ones, if it is possible.
Finaly, I'd like to  practice tennis and to try climbing.
It contains lots of  archeological Etruscans founded and some remains about  Etruscans neoropolis.
I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait on a big queue to be attended by the cashman, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.
As I was so looking foreward to seeing Danny's stage, I was very disappointed.
Also I like to play tennis, which is  beautiful "game" itself and good for  figure.
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet.
I am writing to answer about your invitation which I have receved as a first  winner.
After the show, my friends and me decided to go to your restaurant, but we were amazed to find it close.
It takes 25 minutes  that is convenient to us.
I was training to be a personal assistance to Madonna herself.
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using.
I  never did surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic.
I think this side of the question is balanced because before  effect on our health was less than it is now.
Write me back soon and tell me about your impression   (I mean if you enjoyed the story or not!)
And how much money I am going to need to have there with me?
We  like to go on July, because my wife Catrin just have holidays next month.
In the other hand, I can not sing very well but I would like to do this  there.
I have received your letter  which is make me happy.
I am look forward to hearing from you
Every day, the growth of the modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody's life.
In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body should use  his saved time for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a "natural life" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots.
I'm excited to  go on holliday there and  thanks to you, I will realize a dream that I always wanted to do.
I'll tell you  two activities I chose.
It has abosolutly reduced women's our house working time.
We don't have old-traditioned rules or something alike .
Last week I spent my holiday in London and I've seen your musical "Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed.
Answering on our first question about where would I prefer to sleep, I prefer tents because it is closer to nature and I like sleepping in sleepping bags (=BV bags).
I know you have a good taste in presents!
So all the fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful, practical and comfortable.
In reference about the date of the travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at the University and I only have July to take my holidays.
I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there  many challenges for your new carreer.
Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and  risk of flooding will also rise.
Modern technology has changed a lot our daily life.
So I would like to travel on July.
It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London, since several points didn't worked out as promised in your advertisement.
First of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event.
The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of  chose which is I like.
Because human high won't change so much, unless 10000 years passed.
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went into the show  had been traded by an other actor, who couldn't sing as half as good then Brook.
That was a pop concert with lots of famous singers like Madona, Julio Iglesias, and people like them
I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings, but at the day I saw it, a different actor played.
I've just helped for  staff.
What are you dong today , how is your school?
Or would be our house itself alive?
Finally, I am writing to request a full-refund for my friends and I, because I felt your advertisement was misleading.
But last week we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
I was very please to receive your letter.
They have everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future.
Everyone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value.
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come alive.
However, we would like to suggest you something:
Before that  you have to think  why you need to earn money and how you do that.
Suddenly, my father realised he forgot to close the car.
After,  student is making  speech about what he or she have learned .
AND IS IT ALSO ALLOWED TO BRING MY DOG WITH ?
Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but why did you forget about newspapers?
According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisinggly, it was proformed by a different actor  who I even didn't know the name.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can  apply my holiday only in July.
However, I manage to listen  the music and I must admit that I liked it.
I would be choose a month  July, because I'm free in this time from family's duties.
What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear at the stage at all.
You advertised for my perfect evening out.
I was starting trainning since 1996, and I have never give it up.
He cured the bird to fly with love, and the bird was able to fly.
In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which can disturbe my familly.
It was about Marine, who was our clase friends.
Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked into for the group accomodation and I spoke with the hotel manager for traveling to the conference.
You ask me for some informations - here they are.
We regard that the show might be  great opportunity for the most of us who are interested in fashion and leisure.
Bye and think on this.
houses only will be more moderne and more practique but not very different from our home in the present.
But they don't consider the problems the romours may bring to the famous family or couple.
I  just 15 years old.
But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes cheap and I can't afford it.
therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum  which is really fashinating.
Modern technology has brought  many discoveries which have made our daily lives much easier.
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husband too.
By problems I mean , that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why  were no discounts avaivable?
Secondly, I  suppose the show will start at 19:30, but it started t 20:15.
Sometime I stay alone all the day but I have contacts with many people.
Anyway, what you wanted to know was what has been my job.
It is a dream becames true and was really unexpected for me!
What a fool was I.
I am very happy for the news.
- Some sequences of the gym-lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that presents how  children have their lunch and spend their free-time, what games they play in the school-yard and how they have contact with each other.
Maria was nervous, but  for the first time, she could talk to him as she never did before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person of the world , she gave her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back , after all, everything happened because of her.
Furthermore, this party would be in your hotel like  the following years.
I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in  Sates.
Two days ago  her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to devorce , Maria was so upset that she couldn't keep it  herself.
It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals.
I have already , saw others versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor, who ended with the musical.
In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey made among the students of our school.
At the end of the conference there will be  reseption at the hotel.
I would like to travel in July because I have got  summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August.
It was very well organised , the shows started in the exactly  time and the group were well performed too.
We can need our imagination for answering these questions but we will never know the right answer.
In fact I have been playing the piano for  children's choir for 5 years.
it is fantastic.
JUST AS EXAMPLE,  INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I just had no possibility to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there.
I stood up in front of  audiences and I had given an attention to them.
What are you mistaken us for, Mr Smith?
In addition to these , I can contact to anyone who I want to talk  at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed.
Firstly, it's written that   it will  be played by Danny Brook, but in fact it wasn't.

The next day Mr White was charged for abuses and obliged to resign.
Secondly, I will like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school.

I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family.
Of course, I could listen to all their music  which were so cool.
You choose Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend."
The place  we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage, the equitment, and the lights.
Another point is that the discounts wasn't available although I could red  it before at your notice.
How could you change the actors without saying something to the visitors.
According to all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definatly one of the worsts.
Some people are in a hurry  other are agressive and most of the other are very stressed.
I am not very good  painting, but I like it because  is a good oportunity to  practice it.
infact all the viewers where very dissappointed.
That is the question , which many people ask themselves and other people quite often.
Pat was not a very clever teen-ager and while she was attending the Secondary School she had many troubles with Chemistry.
And  checking his body condition.
I am writing to give you my details and ask  some more information.
I hope I've answered all you questions and I would be please if mine could also be answered.
Then, the show started t 20.15 pm instead of 19.30.
When he  come back home, he was surprise because Maria was more angry than before.
It is a show about  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles.
The second one is more  a hobby.
Have you ever thought about a world without  phone?
But the most important things to enjoy shopping is not to use every  money which you have.
I was really happy when your letter arrived and I  node that I won the first prize in your competition.
We live in a small and old fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: loosing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died  terrified by the darkness which was nearing.
One of them was about her boss' private life: he had got  illegal son.
When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would be, and I was sure I can never, ever live without it.
"X" is the musician who sang songs at a pop concert.

A different actor acted in stead of him.
Then I had  pleasure  listening to your variety of concerts.
They   gona show a latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and new hairstyles.
On 5th of May  which was  national holiday in Japan, I had a part-time work at a pop concert in the Tokyo Dome.
Despite this shopping culture, shopping is not always enjoyable ,
I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction for your perfect organisation.
How has modern technology change your daily life?
It is  really good programme,  especially visiting  Science Museum and  National Art Gallery would be  great opportunity to learn about art and   latest improvements in science.
The cities are the main commercial centre, our streets are full of billboard advertising many things  and.
She told to Pat that she didn't want  other people know  it except her.
It is popular by the students.
She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tries to get rid of him with the help of false accusations.
What else, unless they pass the exam they have to get extra lesson or test.
Secondly, I would like to stay in  tents because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can.
I am  good diffender.
Which was unbelievably great  and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want.
I have been swimming for 8 years for a club and enjoying  a lot.
Then, I suddenly realised that I had no choice, so I took all my courage,  a big deep breath, and crossed it!
My Father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up!
HE TOOK ME RIGHT IN  FRONT OF MY HOUSE.

When I went to her play to see, I realy would love to be a actress.
I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in  flesh.
I payed the same as   who bought the tickets ten minutes before the theatre.
I am satisfied to have received your letter that informed me that I have won the first prize in your competition.
It was  perfectly terrible evening out.
I think it is great and I want to try it.
It is rare the schools that don't have a multimedia centre with many computers to the students use.
Technology brought simple solutions to my life.
I was shoked because I had alredy spoken with them and I had taken two autographs.
I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you  a refund of the amount I paid, or part of it.
Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and other girl.
I also suggest that more plays and films should  be taken place.
Although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity  visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.
She was so frighten and sad that she had no energry.
They are a bit far from town but they have huge car park.
Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer .
which is special place in the town we  lefet just for  comerical area, but of course with all the facilities to get there  like a big supermarket , and mall centre  in different areas of the city.
First the telegraph and the radio an now TV, the telephone and the Internet allowed people be in contact with others really quickly  and distances arent now so difficult of overcome.
lastly about the ticket   advertisment saids ' Discouts Available' but no way  I had to pad  full Â£ 20.00 and  restaurant was closed because of rebuilding  something.
I really enjoyed to serve the drinks to the pop-stars.
Secondly, I actually liked  Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much.
Baking is  passion and in the town  I live I'm known for making the best cakes in the area.
Ok, write  me soon, huge hug and kisses
I am writing to thank you for the first prize in your competition and reply to your letter.
Firstly, I can take my holiday only  the two first week of july because of my work.
Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars  more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls.
Nowadays the modern technology is increasing and it was really affecting our daily life.
Definitly we should try to understand tecnology ,
if we know how to use it, tecnology will improve our way of life.
I arrived at Ireland on 2th July.
And yet , he was too weak to resist the rats , coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death.
If you have any ideas about bigger halls, it will be better.
It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something.
He has a bestfriend, that was more like a brother for him.
When we  entrance the place our problems begun.
I have recollected all  answers and I have made this article.
People buy and buy unnecessary things but, when they  arrives in their houses, they can see an empty wallet.
To sum up, there are both positives and negatives aspects of the modern technology, because it can makes our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us.
I am lucky if I will find something which fits.
This whent on and on, got more and more serious  but it was so secret that  teachers didn't notice.
From my point of view I can complain only on a small concert hall and  there were artist from only six countries.
This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has.
My confession caused a disaster in the life of her and her family, and they called the police to take me out of the planet or  arrested, so that I can't see her again.
Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days  the festival - Saturday and Sunday.
We try to play on many instruments,  sing even if we don't know how.
On the positive side, if I am bored, the first thing that I want to do is watching television or listening to music.
It happened to me once  that I wanted to go on holidays, so I went to the travel agency.
Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size.
In other words, what they will introduce , is most interested in us . I mean it's conflict with your plan , what a pity!
I'm a beginner on both activities.
For all this reasons I do wish that I would  not have been gone see that show, for which the tickets were not available.
To make to profit my ideas my parents lived in a small village near a wonderful country.
One thing you have not told me is weather I have to pay  all things by my own in California or not.
You can imagine how upset we were and we asked you for our  reward for the night that we spent .
I was very delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize.
Yes, there is  big plus for  big store of course.
There are a lot of option and item make our chose difficut.
When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike.
Because my summer holidays break is start at  end of June.
This secret was an opportunity for Pat be the best without  competition but it is a secret who involved his best friend sexuality, and if Ted was a normal person it will be fine but he was the example for all  school.
Now, I will answer your requests.
For example, on the leaflet it was written that there will be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries.
Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs , will those women still thinking shopping is enjoyable!
In short, the Amusement Centre is  fascinating place and it deserves a visit.
Furthermore, I would like to know exactly which kind of clothes I have to take with  and how much money I'll be supposed to spend there.
But in Golf I am a beginner.
 Refering to accommodation I would rather to stay in  tents because I have never gone on camping so I would like to have the experience.
I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions.
I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all  time, what wasn't very difficult.
The other thing I don't like going shopping is in the weekend.
Visitors could learn plays with professionals.
Living better, people live longer and it is necessary to product more food, but more food means chemical agents on  earth, the circle never stops.
The stars and artist are from only six countries, and some concerts take place in small halls.
The accomodation that best suits me is in log cabins, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to have all my belongings in order and packed at all times.
Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to chose and why.
We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.
Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us.
Marc, one of my friends, hit Mr. Heyman with a bottle and he lost his conscience.
It is also written in your letter that we will have to  chance to do two activities.
I think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kind of food could be in fashing.
I'd prefere  if you give me this information as soon as you can.
I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp ,
by the way  my team and I won the last scholl championship ,
I play guard on my team ,
I also like tennis but I am not very good ,
I was wondering if you could give me some lesson while I am there.
After all that  we can notice that shopping can be a good option as long as we can choose other enjoyable activities for our free time.
Her boss was  rich man, really rich.
I am writting  you because I felt dissapointed after seeing the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
It was not until the concert that I became a pop mania.
It started at 20:15, but it was said that it starts at 19:30.
 Swiming I won last summer competition in the school , although I'm not very good at surfing I like , and I always practis in my holidays every year.
I am good at timing on swim.
I have just been  in  tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interested adventure.
First of all, the advertisement of the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage.
I look forward to hear from you.
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary material for camping.
So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart.
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed:
not always, in fact, money and celebrity being happiness.
So why  you make this invitation?
I often begins with finding a parking for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes.
I was very surprised on the result of the competition.
If this happen  I'll write  you to tell you more.
You can't imagine how funny it was!
and there are  very big Park in the Castle.
The date that I would like to travel, that will be nice to go on  1st of July .
I mean that you have to wait until the seller came to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy.
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities of our daily life at school shoud be filmed to give the other students the idea of what we usually do  not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time.
I would like to know which type of clothes I will wear there ,
would you check the weather forecast for me, please?
About the accommodation at camp, I prefer in tents because I love sleep in tents ,
 is more interesting than sleep in log cabins.
By the way, why weren't any discounts available for the tickets, as it was said in the advertisement?
I am writting this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening during your musical show "Over the rainbow" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director.
I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totaly different.
By the following, I would like to inform you that  I've assisted your new musical show,  which name is "Over the rainbow", last Saturday evening, 10th June.
I WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY MOST TRAVELLING IN JULY BECAUSE I HAD TO PASS MY LITERATURE EXAMS BEFORE  AND I'M TAKING IT IN JUNE.
In the street is so crowded that you can't walk like usually and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lost them.
However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange little details.
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world.
His voice is also soulful and sometimes even gave us blissful .
The advertisement saids it is taking place on Tuesday 14 March from 10am to 7pm.
First, as I am very found of Danny Brook, I have been surprised  he totally changed his voice, face, and so on!
But the most important innovation of technology development is the computer.
I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practise new techniques and take pictures of new landscapes.
You could try to do your shopping via  Internet.
Last week I had the chance to spend time in London and this is why I decided to go to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show.
Last month, I helped  at a pop concert  which I really enjoyed.
Let me explain  you why I'm now so disappointed.
Everyone is welcome to join   this party   to get to know each other in a good atmosphere.
I would prefer to stay in  tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around .
They decided to return to his father because he was old and he needed help.
To conclude, will you kindly let my know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me.
I walked  first with Pat and two of my friends.
Well I think the opposite like a year before but recently I think this because I see all the people to go shopping  they don't realised that they are outside in the real world  poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things ,
you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know.
Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without  information or excuse  from the direction.
Since I'm coming during the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me , and I have another question ,
it's about money.
I strongly recommend that making a video about "Upper intermidiate" class.
I hope hear from you  sooner as possible and thanks for understand my situation.
I'm writing back to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me.
First, I'd like to travel on July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto on August.
I believed in the phrase by which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!'
Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people) , consisted in carrying music instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,...
I would prefer to stay in  tents  than  log cabins.
please would you like to explain why ?
Last weekend we diced to go to the bach with Pat and Nick (her boyfriend).
The accommodation I would prefer to stay in   tents because I like adventures and also I will have more contact with the nature.
It's evident that whatever we wear look like clothes, and I think we should stop being so stupid.
Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or  everything is provided for the organisers.
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, of if something terriable has happened with me, I may not run somewhere to find a telephone box.
After the show I felt really hungry, so I meant to go to the restaurant  which occasionally was closed.
Secondly, you cannot exclude that you might get  a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of that you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet from home.
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people of our class are going to work in this sector so it will be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education.
In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all  events was only Â£10 ,
this was excellent ,
it made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked ,
for them it is  really economical  to spent their weekend.
I am understud from your letter , what all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me, including transport to and from the airport.
Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis for activities.
When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone.
The playing was excellent, the public enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group.
In one hand it's because they have not enough money to pay  it and in the other hand it's because they can't move very well  for example if they are disabled.
She works as a model, and she was advicing him about which clothes, etc,... buy for her.
Quite recently, in my country electrical bicycles have been invented.
I want to be a mother of them and a friend of them.
Secondly, the times, it's available  14.30 and 19.30 so I choose 19.30.
Science and Technology is a theme very  discussed nowdays, most of the comunity of our city, and of the world, were technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.
I hope this letter  aswer all your questions, if you whant to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter.
Actually I can't swimming at all.
I would like to ask you what type of clothes should I bring?
Let me make it clear, you blew my time and money.
I would like to say that I am not satisfied of it.
It was of my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts.
I choose this row because I though it was quicker than  other.
So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink.
Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can involve through the camping.
For all that reasons, I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money back to my house.
To be honest,  next great invention of people,  computer, can't work , if you haven't got the phone.
As you know  we are in England to learn your language and also  your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discorve this way of your country!
I don know exactly what is California's weather lime.
There are huge queus to  tills, noise, hussle, poor custumer service.
We will be learning at home using computers and disc.
Students who want home teachers are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and it means they take lessons after school, not in a daytime.
Could you tell me if you would lend me some  material for photography?
I hope you to understand me, so I ask for money back and I hope this wont happen again.
Nowadays, most product's prices has gone up with our own country's economy development.
There are a lot of folk stories in the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia ,
But  it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself.
But i like different stiles of art.
Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent than  in a long cabin because it is easier to clean.
Why famous people couldn't do all this things?
There is a lot of activities and lessons at our school, so I think it's difficult to chose some of them.
It was love of first slight and we were fascinated by the thought ,  building a kind of the same organisation in our town.
It is the only month where I don't work.
Added to this, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount.
I couldn't stand being watched and my furious led me straight to Pat.
Based on everything listed above, I would like to  recieve  Â£10 , which I have paid , back.
I am keen on photography so I would love to participated at this activity , I am very good at that and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others.
The night had been terrible, but it could be saved by a nice dinner in your restaurant, but it been closed because the heater was not working due to  leaking.
In music, before  having a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them into my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I just can record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument  controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds.
Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with  money to buy that you always wanted to.
If  student is ill, we will return the money but you should tell us untill one week before we start.
Some where just friend groups but others took it seriously, maby just a bit too seriously , they gave themselves names and acted as gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or mempers of other gang, trying to start fights with them.
The activities that you have listed forms .
On my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen.
Besides all those improvements and  confort I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us.
During my 2 week's holiday I would like to attend a musical show.
I am writting to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre.
I passed a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother phone Pat's mother and Pat's mother explain  all the story to my mother.
We were all given different sort of jobs to do.
I will take my exams in June and have the result in August.
We could play with our toys, dolls and we could enjoy  without a computer.
I'm writing this letter to tell you  my good experience at a pop concert, last month.
I had to go back to the hotel, because all  restaurants in the area were  absolutelly crowded.
First at all, I'd like to thanks  for the prize  Won.
When I am too tied to go out but want to meet some new people, computer technology provides me with this opportunity.
It looks nice and have  good meaning.
I will do  F.C.E in  University of Cambridge and other tests in several subjects in my high school.
Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of the human rights.
What is more, every places is explained by English.
Human being became more and more clever and built wonerful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands.
However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and  the same time.
The second day objective was to install the scene , with lights, loudspeakers and all  stuff.
But the only problem for the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00.
I was so surprised but so glad to read that I won the first prize in your competition.
Most of the time when we go to the shopping Center we have a lot of fun , we go to stores to see  cloth, we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries, but not all the time shopping is enjoyable.
Finally, I would like to ask you wheather  anything I should bring to this travel such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
On the other hand, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization.
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about somethings that happened in the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, wich took place in your stablishment, The Circle Theater, that made me feel very upset.
People belive that the bird was sent by heaven.
Despite my appriciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I'd choose my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis.
Your dance shows are very beautiful,  art exhibitions is something original and exciting.
The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because the entry of the show is free for students.
Thank you for your letter, which arrived on  second .
If possible, could you let me know what I'll need  for example which clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend .
But everything was terrible and different from your advertisement.
But Lily never tell her what she really want and what her really thought  the thing.
It was a grate pleasure to hearing from you , that I have won first prize in your competition.
Science and technology can give us a better  live style or better food.
I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show "Over the Rainbow",  wich you are the manager.
The fourth day, the singers and the players have been to there to test .
The day of the party all had fun  especially Pat that at the beggining was sad.
The next work I was gives was ironing costumes.
I also had to clean the washing rooms.
I think it is everyting I like to know.
They make their life style much easy  more fast because they need to catch up with the other people.
There is  ambiguity about technology -  can bring good things and terrible things as well.
At some lessons students are always work, but us we work,  joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life.
The Festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from six counties they could be invited really from all  the world.
We bought tickets for the second show, that was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15!
Some people seems to enjoy going shopping and spending money ,
it makes them happy  but what about the ques you have to make to pay for something just to realise, when you get to the front, that they have to close that till and they ask you to move to the next till . what a waist of time.
Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, that would take a much longer time  to be found by traditional means.
If a telephone haven't been invented, we wouldn't have lived perfectly like nowadays.
All did except one: Pat.
I don't know rely what you can see , three hours I think is not enough but near the station there is a beautiful garden  popular for its variety of flowers.
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN FOR THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE.
Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see how the famous Danny Brook act.
In addition to all this, the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered.
And the reason I choose painting is it's being very exciting to me ,
I am not very good at this subject but I would improve my painting.
Last month, I had a great time at the concert of "Dragon"  which is the most popular hard-rock group all over the world.
They use all of this because they want to do their work , and leisure activities with  this helping kits.
 look forward to hearing soon.
It was  absolutely great idea.
Firstly, you spoke about two actors  Danny Brook and Tina Truelove,  instead of them we had two others and they were really bad.
I received your letter asking  some information about  conference
I'm very happy to have won in your competition.
But some schools in my country don't allow many things.
However  all  students are passive.
Another disappointing thing was that I could not get any student discount, even that your advertisement promised them.
We can't listen  music at class as well.
I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressed  and very expensive one, too.
You asked me for an interesting building to visit.
Some people tried to enter without any ticket but they weren't allowed by  police.
It is a excellent price because when I am tempt to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money.
After having visited  shops during 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for .
On the other hand, some companies offer special service  such as sending your order with the post or  on  telephone.
I am really pleased hearing from you , I won the prize.
In my point of vue,  Internet is the most important  discover of the 2000 centery.
I'd like not only to reply but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't "perfect" as you advertised but it was a big disaster.
I was at the show of your theatre three days ago.
He was replaced by a novice actor who made a very disappointing performance.
I have ever slept in tents when I went camping.
In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat in the internet..."
We just sat on the seat and nothing to do.
But it's also true that sometime we aren't able to make a step without it.
Every point were wrong.
I also want to know if I can have a time for shopping.
But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day looking for my mother in a huge department-store.
It is a surprice!
In my opinion, shopping is relaxing  above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday.
I don't really like living in tents.
Since everyone can afford modern technology the life of everyone in the more developed countries has changed completly.
The principal reason is the cheapest price.
I have discussed with my friends and school teachers about this subject.
The only thing which really disapointed me was a visit in your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show.
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about  international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here.
It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight.
Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition.
The idea about going to  science museum is fantastic , I read about the museum,  it is really interesting in science history.
Because it's crowding of people.
I wasted 2 hours to buy food which you can find in every local shop.
At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood , it tend to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use  Internet ,
there are only ten computers in the school ,
only teachers can use it ,
Computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get an access to huge informatonal sources through the internet, to make shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly.
However  if we rely on it too much, we could become lazy and apathetic and  as a result, would not be able to live without them once they are gone.
The show should start at 19.30 , however, the audience have been waiting for  fourty five minutes.
This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of  Niva River with an exellent view on the Hermitage Museum.
Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words  "I am glad to meet you, Paul."
I have  dout when somebody said , that the fashion of the future would be different.
Then at the adverstisement stood that  performance begin at 19.30.
I felt so miserable that Pat laughed seeing me.
Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building.
It becomes a fight about life or death.
I would also like to know whether someone will be at the airport for me because this will be the first time in the U.S.A.
According to your first question, I would like to travel only at July because it is my school holliday so I would not miss any class.
The accommodation I prefer is  tent.
They have always to be careful about what they say and what they do.
When they were young, they judged the other person by his appearance.
The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you can have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even   swiching on the light by saying only ; " light".
First of all  you need a lot of time, because the market is so big.
Almost everyone hates other people gossip in their private things.
It's like a joke, but a bit scarely.
What kind of people will be invited at your Camp in this summer?
What clothes should I taken?
How much money  I need to do this travel?
These are the things that I'd like to chance; I'd like to do what I really want  but I don't know if I'm really ready for this!
In my opinion the better time for shoping is weekdays, preferably in the morning.
Now I asked myself if there will come another problem.
This is my opinion of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it.
I want to change  school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want.
I have  asked to write a composition regarding the question  it is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable.
Thanks to modern technology, I enjoy chatting with my friend in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day.
Again we're so sorry that we  give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us.
it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not , they just try to find the best pose.
I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing make similar sensations, but I have never practised that sport.
the second one is just because I'm  fanatic of that sports (really I'm not martine hingis).
And on the top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters' strike, so I had to look for another place to have a snack.
In conclusion, I would appreciate  if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected.
At this time I promised  that I would never do this awful job again.
For exemple, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I am going on  Internet and ask for what I need.
I was very disappointed because I was longing for seeing them  as a fan.
This is one of a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are buying and getting clothes from the shelves.
Are you understand me?
All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have set , they are quite interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich, because some of us may go to the university there next year.
Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places (castles , builded in  13-th century) or art gallery, as well as  beatiful Bodnant garden.
I think  nextly we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell something to her, finally everyone knew about it.
During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit  restaurant,  it's a pity, but  restaurant was closed because it was too late.
I used to be the captain of the  selection of bascketball in my school, because I was the best to play, and I think I can still remember how to play.
But , I think it's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate  in our life.
We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping.
At first, the research and design courses are exiting since we are studying how cars are built.
We can see on the advertisement that discounts are available.
At homes we have again rules, but more flexible ones.
Unfortunately, our programm is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme.
You've just finished your long hours at work, you  tide, you had  row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping.
I can't leave it until this month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of the year.
What should I say  you about home...
I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling me little and terrible secret to Pat, everithing started going wrong , Katrin  my friend, and the one I was being bad with, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really don't know what to do. I was in love with Brett, but I love my friend too.
I can't be concentrate in a shop, but I can't relaxe as well.
We thought, as usual we do in London theatre, we could have discounts  as it's written on your advertisement .
Secoundly, boys are not allowed to have long hire.
Each time , when she comes back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her weight.
Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I obn't be able to write oben this letter yet.
Secondly, in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30.
But I did not know it, and I told her my secret: I have fell in love with Paul  a friend of us.
What is more, the show is free for all the students.
I wish you are fine.
I was pleased to recieve you letter ricently.
When our final day arrived, we went shoping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show.
I think many people, specially women, had  same experience.
I don't have any material.
The performance started  fourty five minutes later.
For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting  leg , the new medical technology could rebuilit part of your body.
A log cabin doesn't sound like a camp holiday.
Because most students have never been to London before , also we could visit some famous places which we wanted to go .
People are used to go to the shopping because it is easier and familiare , it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch some movie after that, and  if you want  buy something at the shops.
It's good to walk around looking  all the news in the stores.
I have already read the programme, and I agree with that, I think that the class will like going to Sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going to  River trip to Greenwich . Also, they can visit  Science Museum, and they can going to the shopping , on Wednesday 15 March they  going to visit The National Art Gallery, really, I think that is  good programme.
The worst one was that the actor and actress were not the person who had been written  in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed.
When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band.
However, we have to consider about our nature and human-being.
I would like to choose surfing like my second activities.
If we want do something, we can do it at night  same as   day.
It was not  perfect evening for me and my child at all!
Unfortunately, the next evening, one hour before the beginning of the show, we learnt that  actors have been changed at the last minute.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture.
First of all, in the sheet I recived, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actor , thing that is not true, because insted of him, there was another actor, that I don't know what's his name is.
For the last one hundred years science and technology did  big step  if we looking to back.
Like you know  last month , I  had helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot.
However  the majority of people point out one a very old building, which you can find at Barkeley Square.
We do not need to lit  fire in order to cook as in the old days.
I want you to know how  extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival.
Then, surfing in  internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it.
Well, unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply.
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of  accomodation because I have had all  holidays with my parents in luxury hotels before.
The things I did were:  Prepearing and  controling the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition, that the singers were confortable and relaxed, etc.
Only people who could live without it , must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation!
I was in charge of the lights of the stage, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage.
With the help of my home computer I can do all  thing, about money, with my bank.
Regarding the programme you have organised,  it is  great ideas everything that you have planed, but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement.
If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel  going shopping.
I would like to add that it could be definetely a great opportunity because the tickets will be free for students.
I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are based on sharing and how many people is there in one tent.
They also were asked to wear clothes which was in accordance with the occasion.
 Thoug, a few of us would like to consider the "London fashion and leisure show".
I am writting  you because yesterday I went to the musical show "Over the Rainbow" and I had a bad evening.
In conclusion, in the future home our conditions of life will approve, and  computer will be very important for us, but is won't control us, because we still have the most important thing of a home = have , that will be the same as now.
We had a class discussion about shopping, for it I'm writing to tell about my opinion.
That was  bit boring, but it was part of my job.
Hoping that I did not offend you in any ways and that you might take in consideration my suggestion, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation.
I would like playing guitar like him.
My works were for  singers, so I could meet singers and talk together.
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone.
It's hard to be extremely quite for five hours but I reckon it's a good way of education.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT , IT'S WORTH TO POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING:
Also  accommodation and travel costs that is including in the first prize.
This show was for me very disappointing for many reasons : First of all, I was very surprised by the no presence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons  to book a sit.
For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that.
Our school is really very diciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviours.
therefore, even if I agree sometimes   Medias are going too far and write really bad things .
So I am sure you will understand why I  so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incindent.
How is your new school and  parents?
Full of technological tools and instruments in the house full of technological tools and instruments .
My friends told me that if we wake up early on tuesday we can go to  Science Museum  about 8.00 in the morning.
The clothes will be more comfortable but less decorations.
But the thing which I've never expected is Pat betrayed me.
I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate  on the organization.
Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have a free time.
Everything in this room is about wine.
I passed one week in London and during my visit I had the fortune to visit "Over the rainbow" in your theatre.
To teach pupils is not easy, of course.
It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a 'smart' shopper.
It would be better if people have had the possibility to let their cars very near to the Festival during the week-end!
First of all, you must walk down to the Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop, then you take the bus number two that goes directly to the college.

One of them is   fashion area.
It was  last poin  to get me angry.
Then, I was planning to buy three Â£20 tickets because it was mention in the advertisement that there were dicounts available but that was not true, so I just could buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
I have knowladge about navigation, engine, ropes and knots  and  sails as well.
A number of forigen students have recently been increasing.
However, when I went to the theatre, you didn't anything not only discount but also  apporogize  us for  dalay of starting  musical.
I wish that you liked my experience.
Now we can buy everything by  Internet, we can see what's happening in Wall Street, we can send mail in a easier way, by e-mail  and many people has started to work at home by their computers.
Unfortunatly, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

It was closed of some reason I still don't know.
Helen  I will like to ask you how many money we have to take to the Camp?
Because of his behaviour, now Pat is alone and nobody trust in him.
I think you should invite  from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world.
It is not really  good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time.
Also the sports-activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school-life and can be useful to see and check out the moviments of the bodys during the   atletics-school games.
Among the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - ,and Photography - from which I know just the basical skills.
This book stays one of the best  american litterature book.
However, there was not any.
Regarding to the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents more than log carbins because I have a lot of experiences of  built up my own tents.
I had enjoyed so much with my wonderful experience.
Moreover, this complaining is not only about the actor, who ever , the problem is that the show started too late.
And if I need to bring some money could you suggest me the amount?
The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is  great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only from six countries apart from your advertisement.
As you know  Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed being accompanied.

I think it's a very good thing that people read books on the radio because it's a possibility for "busy people" to know important and beautiful short stories and books.
He suddenly saw Alison and said " Did you like the cake , it's for your birthday party".

Everyday scientist and  technologyst discover and produce more and more new things and it is good , it has to be like that, we have to do forword not behind from the point where we are now.
I really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon , very exciting.
Although I am thankful to modern technology!
Fashion is a part of our lives, even for those who will never  reconize it.
So all you need to improve  is to have larger concert halls.
As well, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowaday, however  it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport or everything you have to do.
Last but not last, I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year.
Hunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls , for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy  - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society.
After the concert I had to clean the area and it took a long time because people  were like pigs.
I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30  as it was written in your ad!
I think it  a bombastic.
Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must take 5000$ and bring them up to the street.

One event that should not be missed to film , is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other.

First of all, it is written that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor was not Danny Brook.
Pat obviously couldn't help being silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandalistic press, not knowing that Paul had made up all the story!
On the other hand I have never had a course of climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby.
Computers have changed people's life , many of them can work from home, they don't need to go to their offices.
I don't think there is something I'd like to change!
It was such  disappointing evening out with my friend during our a week's holiday in London.

I trusted him and told  about the reality.
So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they had know her feelings to Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything forever.
All my disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets, but as we wanted to see Danny Brook's performance, we decided to buy them anyway.
Our homes should just protect us  dangeres from outside.
One day, Pat and I were going home, when she asked me , if I will give a party befor I'll go.

I go look round  shops.
The queue is not only the problem  if you go by car there is  parking problem parking, if you go by bus there is again queue and you have to carry many  carry bag carrier bags during the your journey and you won't be alway luky  to find a seat to seat.

I waited and it becomes 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened.
One more thing, the theatre restaurant was closed when I  get there for a glass of drink , I don't know why , there was no written notes or information about that.
At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh.
The teacher looks after the pupil while they are investigating the topic of the lesson.

The major probleme for the industry cities is to deal with the bad effect of polution in the environement.
Note says that tickets  has discounts available, but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is not any discount for   thicket.
Why do you give those information in an advertisment .
And also it's time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple, so far more people can enjoy computer more than before.
And, I forget to say  about  actor, I didn't enjoy them.
Our lives are getting better and better, so people began to go shopping more frequently.

And because it'll be a big building we'll  able to see a whole view through the window.
How much do I need to bring them?
If you don't want to regret about shopping, you have to make a shopping list firstly before going shopping.
If you can improve these points, your festival must be better than this year's.
At the top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being  restructurated, so I couldn't have my dinner either!
I bought  group ticket for the show .
Concerning the accomodation, I prefer to live in log cabins  finding them much more comfortable than tents!
My greatest wish was seeing Danny Brook's performance; you know it's the best singer.
If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area.
about the Hotel   is cling, and  have a good serves  the rooms are dobuels and neche have  owe bathroom ant for the nomber of student we get a good  Valud.
Place is  College garden.
Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip will be cut down.
Second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy.
I hope next year plays and films will be more and that the ticket will be reasonably-priced as this year in way that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival.
For the accomodation, if is possible I would like to stay in  camping because I think  is a relaxing place where to stay.
People said she was seeking something and  still seeking  even if she had dead for 500 years.
The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion, hairstyles and make up, and also  leisure and sports wear.

It is just  polite's rules.
The end-of-conference party is designed to give  rough ideas about many different cultures.

Instead of going to the science museum, we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show  wich is opened on Tuesday, march 14  from 10 am to 19 pm.

I think the people will wear clothes which are metalic or bright colourful colour with  mixture of history and future fashion style .
I was very glad to hear that I won the competition.
I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet says, however  it did not happen.

They decided to build more school  specially in Switzerland because the people  were considerated clever.
Will you provide it?
Furthermore, I would like to stay in log cabins  which I could feel  more American style of the accommodation.
We were very disappointed because before this happened we pouded the tickets but there were no discounts available.
We all know that you organised everything.
She was always been aftering by  media.
Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the whole ticket's price.
Do I need to bring any special clothes or gize?
But it was a good experience for me because I learnt how to claim down and play well in front of the audience  the concert.
This is not a tabu  by me and my friends.
You are not allowed to smoke, drink or to take some drugs in my school.
And you have written in your advert , that there would be discounts available, what wasn't possible this evening.
First of all they say about   enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others .
One day, when they were arguing, Pat was very anxious and told what she knew to  police.
I would like to know some more information about the Camp, before I left , which clothes are more appropriate and how much money should I take with me .
The show started late (  about 45 min.)
First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there.
What is more, there were no discounts available for the ticket fees nor we had the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons.
Last year, on a Saturday evening  my boyfriend phone me at 20 h o'clock and said  me, "Would you like to go to the cinema with me " I asked my parents but the said  me  "No  you can't go to the cinema, tomorrow you have school.
There was no any light outside our house,  no light on the road or field either.
With attendance to the annual international arts festival which you took place on 21 and 22th November 2000, I spend  tremendous two days enjoying some features.
People were using candles to see around them.
They are  loosing time of their life for nothing.
We all are interested in fashions and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity for as because students have not to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour.
it is really easy to reach to the conference from the hotel.
From the past until now, we have  wearing several different  fashionable clothes, but why?
Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadgets with old clothes, like a dress of the middle-Age.
Furthermore, I found it very short time and they offered me  new project for the summer.
I have found  very expensive to buy them but there are  number of advantages.
I could be fine if I had seen more countries from all around the world, for instance :  far east, indonesia etc.
Also I bought a Â£20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for Â£10 Â£15, Â£20 tickets.
Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there was not  discounts for ticket, while you wrote the contrary.
About the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in  log cabins, because for me and my family's more comfortable.
First of all  I would like to thank you for the perfect organisation of the competition which I luckely won , I have been really very impressed.
We lied on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volley matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming.
First of all, I was really furious of watching a show starring by a different actor, instead of Danny Brook .
This is the fact that shopping is not enjoyable.
As and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours, and don't waist your time asking for  promosion advertised in the windows of the shop.
That time I had to sleep in  tent.
It will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable.
A few students and me have heard about a fashion and leisure show.
I hope you can enjoy .
I think it is worth while to see .
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century.
So I have must more interestings things to do in my life.
I usually spend my time on playing computer  about three hours a day.
Secondly, It is accommodation.
Even we could make a trip to Paris in the school holiday!
In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think ,  better quality in clothes will be created in every field, such as sports, office, leisure, building site, school and space.
If I cannot get your satisfying reply within a month I shall go to the consumer protection organisation to sue you.
I have never used it and I think it would be more exciting than tents.
Thank you very much for you time.
I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as  anual sport turnament or wellcoming evening for new students.
I usualy sing in my spare time and my friends love  when I sing and about swimming I was champion last year in my city.

How is the home of the future will be?
These days, there are so many people  like shopping that it is one of the important part in our life.
My parents are afraid of it because I  took my licence only in September.
I must say that  our perfect evening wasn't out!
I would like to sum up by saying that every person, either famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed.
About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in  tents because it will be a new experience for me.
You could do anything you like as long as you have good grades.
Many people enjoy going shoppings  meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience.
WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS CARD AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, SPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED UNDER THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M.

I would be appreciate it if I could stay in  tents at  Camp .
It must be a great opportunity to see the show because we are keen on fashions and clothes.
So I am fully entitled to ask for  refund except for evening out.
It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days, when the temperature increases.
By the way, I would like to travel in July, because just I have free time in July.
Evry family has now  T.V., to travel for long distance we using not just  car and elso  train and airplain.
The show started much later, on 45 minutes later than it should be so I was late for the bus.
About the information requested from me  I have to say that I can travel only  July because of my job; I am busy until the end of June.
The only thing is  we need to know what kind of thing do we want to buy and where  could we buy cheaper and more quality stuff.
PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY  FEW DAYS, AFTER  THE SECRET COME FROM THE DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID.
I realised I had to run away, but I had still her letter.
For the students it is free.
For the colours, I think the metalic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular.
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unkown actor who starred instead of him.
What do you want more?
According over programme we have a free time on Wednesday, March 15.
In schools we aren't allowed to speak in classes.
People now had the chance to move to far away places to spend their leassure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home-countryside.

After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but as I arrived in the restaurant it had been closed.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in the tent.
In addition, although you advertised the discounts tickets  available, they do not sale them any more according to your staff.
Also the person was not really good at acting.
Those are only my opinions , you don't need to agree with it, but one day you might found out that what I have said is not totally wrong.
We will not use black clothes as we are used to do.
I will go to your office this week.
In addition to all this, there was no discount in the price of the tickets , for students either, contrary to what I was told by  phone when I asked for more information.
After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun and we will eat in Mc'Donalds.
But it was completely different one  which I had expected.
On the other hand, everything at the shopping is more expensive, because the people that buy on it usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need it is already at this place.
Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in  dangerous and poor way and I don't know how, but he could persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, in my 25th birthday.

This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style  we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them.
So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big festival, I would rather stay at home and watch television.
I would prefer  tents to sleep  at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents  to compare   in a house.
It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what will clothes be like 100 years from now.

Second, I went to the theatre  exactly seven thirty in the evening.
I haven't seen any discounts available , I though my son would  payed less than I.
And I didn't even got paid.
The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but in this evening it started at 20.15.
I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together.

One of my friends suggested that we should have had  part time job  which was that.
I am writing to inform  that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place in the university and it will start in August.
Another thing that  regardes  me, is that I enjoy my self more when I know I have to do shopping for me than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!

Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently.
Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center?
Because of my "isolation"  telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and  internet so study or do researches, because there are not  book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend.
If you asked the young people what they spend their money the most in, most of them would answer 'clothes'.
So it was not "my perfect evening out" and because of my disappointment I am here to ask you  some money back.
I have never felt such as satisfaction.
Yesterday I went to the theatre play called "Over the Rainbow"   which I saw the advertisement in todays Guardian.

And finally, I would  had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I  go to 'Theatre restaurant'.
On the advertisment it also said , you could visit our restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason.
Because of the modern technology, the safety level in my car is very high.
So you can see that it was not a so perfect  evening for me then I  thought.
One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer county during the winter.
I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time  very much.
Is wonderfull how the tecnology make things so easy.
In surf I am not good at all.
In my eyes they are wasting their lifes, they are hopeless.
But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality.
I was enthusiastic about the special event.
I also would like to know how much money I will get from you for those two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes.

Maria and Ivan were again poor.
And I love to learn surfing and painting.
Finally, we had a totally unhappy night with your show.
I've been dreaming  to travel to  U.S.A for so many years.
Then  suddenly, Pat's face turned to look confused and  said in a small voice, ' Haven't they broken up  long time ago?
It was and old woman asking who was Maria.
She spend the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock.

Last summer I went to  amazon on an expedition with other 10 people , such as a guide, a doctor, a scientist &amp; all the rest  as me were just curious.
Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California on July.
Besides I would suggest filming a lunch to the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noises inside the restaurant because of  babbles.
The more  seeing her I could, the more ambitious I became.
I mean, all that flashing lights,  the changing colours of them, I believe they helped much.
I think that it was very stupid, but it was the most difficult thing that the humanity can do.
you should close the theatre untill the restaurant get appropriate to use.
More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time  comper to travelling by public transport.
To make it worse, neither discounts or restraurants were available at that night although they were said to be available.
At first several days, Pat all the time was with us.
People  inventing new kinds of clothes and people  buying and wearing differents clothes.
We could show  team spirit of our school with sport activities like soccer, basketball or handball.
I am writting about this letter that I recently received from you, which is about a competition that I have won the first prize.

- Later on we'll go to sing the song of "Old McDonald had a farm".
Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with  hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in.
When appeared the first car, it was already a great success.
Anyway, to participate in two-weeks  Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information.
When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friend and to my family than before.
When you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they don't like shopping but I suppose it is not true.
Yes, there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back.
I have just attended classes about them.
First of all, I was really looking forward to see one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, what disappointed me very much.
Lastly, I think that all this changes won't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead  abruptedly.
In one hand scientist discovered a lot of medisent from different illneses, but in an enother hand they discovered many illneses about which we haven't herd before.
Secondly, although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre, we could not be given any discounts only because we had done at a travel agency.
So I payed  the ticket.

It was built on the top of the hill and around  there is only a huge field.
Your only work consist in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner  for instance;
It was  very good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class would enjoy.
I like taking photograph, in my only room.
Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enough, it will be better to have the possibility to watch more movies.
You had better invite more  nationarities' people.
I think this festival is a great idea because it's a possibility to see and to love the art, but , I think also there are some things thas could be changed.
 Celular phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car is broken  on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth.
It would be the most excising activity in this trip.
In my opinion, small  and the markets  outsides should be supported , on the other hand  the big supermarkets should think more about the recyling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.
I hope to hearing  you soon
Novadays our shopping habits seem to be changed.
Danny Brook didn't play at the performance, there was another  unknown  actor.
With the help of  "Internet" it is possible to get much objective and useful information you are interested in.
Abviously, I have to chance other row.
It was in lunch time.
I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into  Palace Hotel.
To conclude we could film our teachers life too.
It could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves.
How much money should I bring with me for  two week stay?
SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER ,
Beside this, I am very good at playing basketball.
I suppose that you are understanding my situation, because you did not say the truth.
We have been talking for hours in our class about the treatment of the media regarding famous people.
I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins , because I have had a camping once and I stayed in tents.
Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally, which just came out of Paul's house.
Finally, I'd like to mention  reasonably-priced weekend ticket.
I would be really happy if I could apply Singing and Photography as the activities you have written about.
In addition to this, the timetable  19.30  wasn't correct.
Because of the crowd.
The conference is  situatet in the building opposite the bus stop.
I want playing tennis and  swimming.
Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes on the seat  so it made me upset.
When the show started I was on the stage close to  famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie.
So, in my opinion, new tecnology has changed, is changeing and will change my daily life ,
I hope that after my life is better.
This is a precise letter that I write  you now.
First of all, dishwashers are very  effecient for me because I work full time and look after my children.
I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose seeing Over The Rainbow, but I didn't even see him on the stage.
Almost all the people had a Television which provided events around our county very quickly.
I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow   musical show  which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night.
I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all  paid  in advance.
However  most famous people, for example football player and film stars, have not got any privet life.
Everyone will not walk on roads.
I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with the others.
if I have to take  special equipement to the activities that I've chosen
A simple example, we can  at the same time  wash our clothes with a washing machine, record a tv program and talk to someone on the other side of the world.
They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet proof and other dangerous liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves 
These clothes have to be made of something light, suitable to wear and protective.
As a matter of fact, when the musical show was over, I was really hungry.
That  why I couldn't have swimmed yet.
if you don't mind, we can go for shopping in this free time.
I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have choosen two from your list: Basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been taking part in a strong team for three years.
I am writting to give you the information that you asked me for.
Otherwise as producing new electoronic, our home of  future will be more convinient.
For me modern technology are things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, Hifi sound systems, television or even cars.
It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around  just making a click with your mouse and you are there.
As an example let's have a look and we will see of this nation  how it has developed.
On the other hand if you can walk  without anytime problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable.
These days people have been shopping more often than they used to.
Now I will tell you in brief what exactly happened to me.
By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them just from only six countries.
Why   medias are so interesting in famous people?
They describe the future world where people would travel to the moon.
I am writing this letter to you to show the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and the real life.
When I was twenty years old, I had to go to  Army.
Why to film the school?
I think that  International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful.
I like to singing a song when I am alone.
I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have  one month break at July, so please make my log cabin ready by july.
I appreciate all about this.
In the afternoon we go shopping  how you have organised in your programme.
In 100 years most of the clothes are made from syntetical material.
But the question is: Why shopping is not always enjoyable?
Finally, we would like to say you to think about our suggestion ,
the show would be fantastic ,
we would know about the latest fashions, the Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to  make up.
Will I need to go with how much money?
First of all, when I paid  my ticket I noticed that nobody could obtain the discount you'd written about.
But also I'm aware of that the time flies for me.
 Internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations.
Contrary to your advertisement I had no "perfect evening out" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 Â£ I paid for my ticket.
Secondly, I would like to live in log cabins while I am staying at the camp.
Also, it was certain to me  to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student.
The report is based on  opinion of more than 300 pupils.
' You've told me that you were going to put it in your wallet.'
First of all, I belive that if someone has time to go to the shop has the possibility.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU IN A VERY NEAR FUTURE.
It will be a pleasure for me give you the information that you need.
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressed situations.
If someone doesn't have enough knowledge about the event which he attends, even if he wears clothes  neatly, he doesn't look like a gentleman.
People in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to.
I think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household.
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, I strongly reccomend it for their excursion and  their interests.
BESIDES  THAT WOULD KEEP US OUT OF DRUGS, DON'T YOU THINK SO?
I was regretting I risked staying at the park alone.
They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared, but not every one beleives it is really so.
In my opinion, the main advantage is  developing of medical technology.
It seems that going shopping is a sense of living.
I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you will, in which I also play the guitar.
It was very nice to hearing from you.
Do I need a lot of money etc. for  different excursions
' It's me!'
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer.
I am rather good in it.
And we knew that from the day on , that  he knows anything about our secret we will live in danger  being caught.
The microphones all had to be controlled.
It has a interesting past.
And due to these bizarre situations I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink.
What do you think if we will go to visit the Arts Museum?
Moreover, many sport activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on.
 I've visited it last evening in your 'Circle Theatre'.
The International Arts Festival is a beautiful idea.
It helps me in preparing my homeworks.
Also, there was said  to be discounts for the ticket but I saw nothing like this.
Lots of people came  this area, and I also learnt how to arrange something.
So, we can be connected other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond to other contry people in real time by using  internet.
Further more, I should choose between two activities and  how good I am at each one.
I always use many electric products; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juice, fridge.
Before using  mobile-phone, if someone wanted to talk to me immediately, they couldn't find me where I was.
We really liked the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for  London fashion and leisure show that will happen on tuesday and we are very interested in go.
I hope we will meet next year in the festival.
After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to see it.
This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish  something good.
Fourthly, the restaurant was closed for renovations and you don't have to propose us to go.
In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there are always some fun you can find.
When we entered inside of it, we saw a lot of fans using T-shirts, caps and shouting, "Almendegos, Almendegos..." (that is the name of the band).
Do you remember when I told you that my dream was helping Mano''s group?
 Internet on our body".
If you don't do that, I will tell  public what you are wrong in your advertisement.
(I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday)  when I found a beautiful store ,
I stopped in front of it and start looking at the window  (outside), then I thought  interesting and came in.
My life have been changed by technological  improving.
Then the show already started at 20:15 and not at 19:30!
A short video, showed to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school.
As a my second activities, I would like to choose photography, because my education was including photography , I love to take some photographs about nature.
I am writing to complain about your product.
Of all the recent technological advances, the one that had the great impact on my life was the Internet.
The last month  was a robbery in a commercial centre next to my house , somebody stole a lady's purse with all her identifications, credit cards and cash, even more her flight ticket.
I enjoyed  dance shows,  jazz and rock concerts.
But how can it be, it was closed!
How do you do?
For instance, reading, looking for some information or using  computer.
We're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day.
I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets.
So, I have decided to chose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them.
One of the points because , I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play!
When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant 
I could not get in because it was closed as the chef of the restaurant was not there.
And, because of these faults, I'd like to have my money back.
In fact it was quite different from the one I had expected to see.
I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won, in which you required some additional information.
The tickets were a little expensive but I was with other TEN people, so when we read "Discounts Available" we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for group of numerous people.
I am very glad I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am looking forward  my holy day   begins on  first of july  to twenty-first july  so it is possible to take the  travell in this time.
Most that took a long time.
The trial was long and had a wide coverage by  media.
After all  things that I have mentioned it is clearly seen that shopping is not enjoyable.
Eventually, the restaurant which belongs to the theatre was closed.
And look at  now.
A lot of famous people have been to this library before!
It  worthes  tp spend time and money on that.
Especially to the science museum because we  all doing science in school.
I'm looking forward to see you next summer after my exams.
In this area you could also find another different buildings, which would you attract.
 It was writing on the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to play with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who played.
In the advertisement the time when the show should start was 19.30 but it started  20:15.
I'm looking forward  hearing from you.
I looked to my watch: 20:45.
I have just recieved your letter saying that I have won the competition , I must say I was really surprise and happy to have the oportunity to join the Camp for two weeks.
I love to take photos but I don't have  techinique.
I would like to know if I should take  winter-clothes, and I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money is necessary for the trip.
The building of  Academy of Art in St.-Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting as  historical as educational aspects.
If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comfort (born just in the "industrial age") everything had to be done by hands or by animal work: I think in that time life was really  harder than now!
First of all the hotel Richard Brown has been loocked in is the Palace Hotel.
In my point of view, modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions.
Especially I liked that time.
We are sure this is suitable to all of us.
Finally  at your last day  I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town.

In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring  lugguage and shopping bags.
Whole night, I felt backache ands shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well.
After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price.

An actor was changed and the pubblic were no informated.
Everybody says I have an excellent voice , I like to sing when I painting too , it's so relaxing.
This would be a great opportunity   because we are all intrested in clothes, sports and fashion.
You won't dance but the earning is guarantee!
I am always joinable with my mobile phone, that is also sometimes boring!
I could not get them.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at (0297) 8245123 in case of need.
We suppose that in  free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping.
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it!
In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you have mentionned in the advertisement , so we were disappointed.
And ofcause this stops me everytime to live  sociable life.
In addition we will have the possibility to see the newest make up and hairstyles.
To sum up, all you make in small cuantities is good and funny, but don't encrease them if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.
The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing School homework and  evening learning with my Computer.
She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understandable.
We all are exited about the programm you've prepared for us, especially about the visiting the National Art gallery.
Other students work as house or office managers, make promontion of different goods or even  as a bouncer.
In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private life of the famous people.
And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard job we all were a little proud to be here.
Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of  holiday.
Moreover, what do  think how much pocketmoney we will spent on this trip .
My composition is going to focus in two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life.
In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which has been closed for repairing since one month ago.
I would like to know about  clothes , which are suitable for activities.
So, people wont have to clean their houses because there are  machine for all  works.
I would rather prefer to stay in the tent than to stay in the log cabin because the tent is more enjoyable.

Yesterday was Valentine's day here in Portugal ,
In particurely I had to spend it alone... again.
I entered in this competition because I have always wanted to do these kind of things.
For example  if you look back into the forties and compare the home  with nowadays  you can see that it has become more modern, especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom.
It seem be incredible, but it's  commun habits for us.

What's my fund limit?
For instance, I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to spend water, although I should do it.
In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the options and choice that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen  along with some questions.

Dear Mrs Helen Ryan,
What  I have to pay by myself?

Therefore, the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main times that make our life.

I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and products.
First of all, thank you for your good programme.
Though  Internet has a lot of positive aspects  I think you should be careful with it and not to be depended on it.
A lot of love,
First of all, I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month.
We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention , time is not a really problem.
The easiest way  from the hotel to the conference is with the bus.
Thirdly, it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing they were not available.
Two days later  in the morning, the policeman came to  Peter...
Although according to your programme, we will be visiting  Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon, we would like to make a suggestion which can help us to be able to stick to both.
I would prefer an accomodation in  log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent.
God bless the one who invented the Internet!
While this two weeks I would like to stay in  tents because you can be nearer to the nature as you are on  log cabins.
If these people have a family with children, they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people.
Maybe because of this, just like living things, the clothes have evolution.
It can cause lots of problems to our health.
As the third point , our tickets were not discounted at all!
It was great that you organised  Art Festival in this City, because people realy needed this kind of sochibal activities here.
I remember some  sientific cartoons when I was younger I watched on television.
I just hope not to get injured.
Because it's easy to manage the  artist schedule and  audience can enjoy the live.
Another point in  favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet.
(for example  bath, car park, free internet access, etc.) 
They also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference by walk.
The prises for lands are getting increasing it's because of this reason.
As expected, I want to talk at first about my school and then about my home.
As I'm not keen of being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops.
It was brillient, because if I had to pay  all things each I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.
Moreover, it seems that the students prefer the soccer play to be filmed.
Hungbu had nothing but his twelve family.
To conclude, I would say that to have a nice moment shopping you had better to save a lot of money and buy something as soon as you see it or be very patient.
So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium.
2 Most part of students are very shy when the teachers ask them if they have one doubt in some subjects at the classes.
It is like his one of bad habbits.
We waited to start the show  about one hour and fourty-five minutes.
For me, it's very stressfull and I usually run a lot to do it.
Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time.
I am really enjoying swimming.
The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6 year old son had to pay  full price.
SECONDLY, WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE  CONDITIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONES, BY  INTERNET, WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ALSO ABROAD.
I hope it's may help for next year's festival.
Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything.
You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait forever until  you want.
I would like to make some  appoitments about the event that I had been .
Dear Mrs Smith,.
Hello Maria.
Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people.
I have also a licence for sailing but I have not done it for a long time.
On the advertisement , that I have received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept wainting for it to start for half an hour.
The season for this is the global warming, which is the salvation of the problem and another reason why this idea is possible.
When we arrived, the were a lot of people, the pace was beatiful, all seemed perfect.
I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take.
I've been always wanting to go   U.S.A.
This is the most   argueing point.
I saw the pink  colored snow there.
I'm not a kind of person who can easily fall a sleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent.
After all this  I wanted to make my evening pleasant however for my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because  some problems of sanitary.
The biggest difference the absence of TV had made in my life was that I actually started living.
It is no doubt that  functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of transformation, for example , have been.
However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right of privacy.
Although I do not play perfectly, I play quite well, but I would still like to practice.
 I asked my parents and they said  alright you can go to Pat for sleeping.
It was really a reasonably-priced weekend for me, but you should also recognise new activities like competitions on singing songs ,  drawing a portrate next year.
The show started forty-five minutes later and this really disappointed me.
We would like to request if we could go to this show on the 15th March instide off  the visit in the Science Museum.
However, there was something good to me.
On your advertisment, it said that discounts were available for the tickets.
It was two years ago , me and my classmates went to a leadership trip in London.
Do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these nosy paparazzis?
What is more they are the Leisure and sports wear, which we are keen on seeing it.
It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, how it was told in the advertisment.
When we are having a shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for a shopping is too crowed and it makes us more tired.
I was so excited that I couldn't believe .
The Hotel is near the station and is call "Grand Placad".
Besides the boredom of having waited for forty-five minutes, we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show, since it was already closed by the time the show finished.
I am afraid , but I want my money back.
It is to save our Earth.
That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA.
Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years .
An other advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it.
There are a lot of  tile in the shop but most of them are close.
They prefer new original style in order to show them more attractive.
Therefore, I think it is  great idea to visit the show for our knowledgement.
A friend of mine went to see it the last May.
I know a ship but an airplane made an arrival to here be quick.
IN JULY WE HAVE GOT LOW SEASON AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO GO THEN ON HOLLYDAY.
Besides, to pay one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time.
My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert.
It will be  fantastic experience for me.
I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I like musical and also I like Danny Brook.
I would like to ask about the money.
First of all, it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in a real show, it wasn't.
Can I change some moneys in the Camp or near it?
Secondly the starting time of the show was far from punctual.
So I need now a "perfect - money back -" for replacement of your "perfect evening out".
Then, I consider  a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress.
I think no.
Because it was just a waste of money to go to your show.
 English class is going to make a short video about  school daily life.
I usually don't buy a lot of them but I must recognise that some of them are useful.
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect .
I would prefer to the accommodation at the camp a tent , the reason is that I like to live realy natural and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent then in  cabins.
I have never practised this sport, so I can't play golf at all.
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear .
Most of the modern jobs involves computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and  Internet, a kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk.
But I think the best technological invention which changed my life is the internet -
In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't had this possibility and the family where we were staying with , kindly boiled the water for us.
And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach, as there are about 35 internation students,  they are all strangers here.
From my surprise, it was closed.
I look forward to heard from you
To make matters worse, because of the late starting, the theatre restaurant had already closed after the show finished.
Modern life it has been full of science and  tecnologies.
I was greatful to hearing about I have won first prize in  competition.
I have never work without a computer, but if we hadn't any  we would it find normally.
Secondly, as you know  we'll have a party after the conference, which will be taken place at our student council hall with some meals.
I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem, you can contact with me any time.
About the activities listed on your letter, I choose basketball and singing.
So I would like to suggest you to change the part of  programme for visiting this show.
Secondly, the show of 19:30 only started at 20:15; Thirdly, your advertisement said: "Discounts available"; but it wasn't the case.
I'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I  gothave become accostomed to some more comfort.
I have been learning  since I was 15 year old.
To sum up, according to the survey, it's obvious that more than half of  students want  acting lesson to be filmed.
You can have a shopping on the internet and it might  the fastest way to gather any information you would like to search.
But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you know it would be closed.
From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular.
But when we thing   properly  shopping is not enjoyable  for example  if you forget something that  need for  salat.
Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students.
It was about 21:00, I thought it was  bit later but it wasn't my falt anyway.
Firstly, there was a different actor/actress who I have never heard their name before.
So they found both the person they dreamed from.
One of the most positive aspect of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket.
According to the title of the advertisement, which was a great idea, there were stars and artists from around the world ; but they were only from six countries.
However, these days were unforgatable to me.
During my stay I read an advertisement of a musical show being held at The Circle Theatre.
As you may hear, our city is well known for the musicals.
I wish you were there.
It was very interesting and  enjoing.
But at night, when it became dark the dreams were coming.
It made me so  dissapoint and angry.
The area for parking, space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really  appropiate.
Since the end of the 40's  which is the period where the technology started , nobody can say that nothing has changed.
.. The particularly bit that I liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar , you know how much I love playing guitar , and all these video cameras were just filming us.
I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example  all 24 hours in a day, and the all things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who  is your friend, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with.
To sum up, modern technology will bring lots of changes and our daily lives would be more convenience.
You can see the sign of  hotel.
When the sons were old they began to tell about their life  beginning with this story  happend a long time ago
If you have any more questions, write me back.
I was pleased  to see Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the scene!
All the shops are full of people, and people treat the  articals like rubbish .
The museum is located in Ouchy, in front of the "Delamuraz Hotel".
Every season we can see  arrival of new styles, fabrics and proportions.
There are a lot of shopping style on the world 
I am sure everybody  prefer one of them.
If you do it, there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them.
In regard to the activities, I would like tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have  some techniques , that I would like to put on practise.
But when I was fifteen my favourite book  "  Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie".
Also, in the advertisement you have mentioned discounts which were not provided.
First of all I would like to say that I think it is important to concentrate this video in   few but interesting part of our daily life at school
Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm  student but I paid  a full ticket).
In conclusion I think that there must be more  compehension and respect between famous people and the media.
Because I never live in  tents before.
It would be better if you have some  large halls , like your "Arena" hall.
I have great experience for sailing.
you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tell you "I'm sorry, this one is sold out"!
Enclosing  information you asked for, there are some points , I want to point out.
I would not like to take legal action, as it would not be convenient for both of us, but I will if I consider it necessary.
Modern technology have been changing the human life since the first many was born.
Firstly, I can travel only in July because I have no time except  July as I am a postgraduate student.
When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill.
After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad remembers of this evening.
Tell hello to your parents!
My mother, whereas was very keen on shopping  everything.

If you would like to gain more information, you will ask me everytime.
But I hope you will wear  formal suit and dress.

As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves  which  leads to changes in fashion  but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans, which was invented ages ago in America.
Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor was starring in the actual show and his performance was literally horrible, and disappointing.
She said to herself  "I am just a servant in this castle ,

For example, all infrastructures  such as  transports and power stations  are ran using computers 
 government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kids of services and businesses  such as hospitals and supermarkets  use them as essential capitals.
There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and  no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference.
For me  as an scientist  it's a main problem to show how the inovations of the last century  goes up with the environment and natur.
Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandales usually increase their fame, even if they did anything wrong.
I would appreciate  if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take.
I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourites ones.
Because of it, I was waited for a long time ,
We spent a brilliant night.
And last, at the end of the program, we would like to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance.
I am really expecting going camping

First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize.
In addition to this, we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel  which is comfortable enough and in a good location.
Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken, with a lot of bills to pay.
I had read about it that was a very enjoyable show!
I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment .
However, I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic.
In spite of these, there is also make up and hairstyles  which attract girls most.
I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show "over the Rainbow" you presented  the 10 of this month.
There are a lot of interesting activities and it makes  hard to choose only two.

The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classic , which were fantastic.
I've heard that  Leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are really wonderful.
For the activities I would like to chose the Tennis activities, which I am not too bad at, and climbing, Which I have never done but  must be interesting.
First thing is a computer.
We are always trying to have more things, that in spite of care after us family, us future, or other things which are probably more important than a new perfum.
I was so impressed  the exhibitions of the festival that you had organized.
Firstly, the great boom of massive comunication wich happened in the beginning of our decade, with the devellopment of telephones, radio stations, television and even satelites, and of course, the internet, gave common people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this provided health and education researches to increase as well.
Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I knew all the truth.
I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station.
I am delighted to answer you back to give you more informations about me since I have won such a nice price.
Because the fashion has repeated many times in the circle.
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying cloths.
It's a very favourite sport also in our region (area), but I did never found time to do it.
Even  I could meet some friend, but I couldn't express my heat to them for we have different  back ground and our first language were different.
It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you ,
I think you should do a baby-parking ,
in fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their sons.
I shall have a look into the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen.

furthermore I simply love sea-sports and their chalenges.

Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour later.
I came to that show only for see him and when the actor appear, it was another one.
Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned.
I will use some photographs to put in one website , that belongs of one magazine, that I had projected.
I spent some great days in Vienna where I had the chance to help at the concert of "pearl jam".
I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end we had a big fight about everything.
Further because I like to live in contact with the nature.
If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take foods and cook it with a microwave.
I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school.
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me.
However, since I was a child I have noticed that  except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages.
I am really happy to receive  letter about Camp California from you.
You wrote that the favourite actor will be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing.
steel or iron, which use for our building , it can make it stronger and not easy to destroy.
Basically it's a free time for the students to look round here by themselves.
Inside of the castle is always dark  even in  daytime.
At the end of  conference you can dance and singing together.
I prefer this accomodation because I think it's more easy to met people when you live in  tent, near them, than when you live in  log cabin.
One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel  wild life more than  I stay in log cabins.
As a whole, I have to say that I got something completely different from what I had expected to get.
What kind of chosen do I have to take
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in Aougust to earn money and after  (from September to June) I go to university as usual.

When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day.
What's about the fashion in 100 years?
I was very  nervious.
I want to do this two activities while I am at the camp: Sailing and photography.
First, you asked abut the travel time and the only possible time for me is in July, because my company only gave me holidays  in this period.
After that we have to make sure that we explain how is it the relationship betwen teachers and students, showing the several time that we have been out together.
As I never did this in whole my life could you tell me if we have to do our own meals or I can find everything ready to eat there?

Apart from this, computer's advanced technology allows me to contact anyone at the moment that I want to, while five years ago  when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters  which was a slower way to contact with people.
Those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use  different kind of cooling  and will tell you if your forgot to close the door!
All this activities which should be filmed , are  our daily life at our school.
Another change in my life is that I use  Internet as a library when I write my course papers .
A came to look at my favorit actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but  whom I saw were another people.
You shouldn't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because its so boring.
I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give   details , which you would like to know.
Well, at first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holidays here in Portugal.

You've asked me how was the Leysin Rock Festival, but I still cannot find the words to explain how fabulous and unexpectable it was.
It would be grateful if you can reorganise this matter at your earliest convenience.

Dear Mr Helen Ryan,
Everyone  had or will have one while shopping.
They are always suffering  the revenge that Heathcliff  swear,  cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in.
Everything was ready and me  too.
Probably, you will agree just to put  London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of  Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday.
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner, a his friend, ask him if he was very happy about his present, the new gold watch, he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends.
LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAD TO CARRY SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS FOR   PREPAIRING MY LUGGAGE  PUTTING ONLY THE APROPPIATES CLOTHES.
First of all I would like to  apreciate  for your generous award.
First of all  you said Danny Brook is in the play but  different actor was in the roll.
But I'm really happy , that I had even  small role in making people enjoying themselves.
I'd like to ask you some questions: Is  necessary bring  money to the Camp?
I went in London for a week of "pure holiday"  thinking   to have some fun coming to see your musical show.
The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw in the tickets that  will be discounts for it, but, they didn't make us discounts!
The restaurant was closed 'cause of illness.. of who?
Firstly, I was very  embaracing during the concert, but all the staff were very kindly with me and Tom too.
Po Lin Temple is opened to  public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday, and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday.
Another one is that how much money I have to prepare.
I went to the Circle Theatre, three weeks ago, to see "Over the Rainbow", the musical show that was played at this moment.
Since then I live in Area 57, and this is my diary life.
I got confused and  disappointed again.
I have heard that the Camp California is famous for surfing, so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time.
Thank you for your last letter ,
I'm really envy you holiday under the sun.
It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing.
I'd also like to get in touch with nature, and that is a great way .
First of all  I have been attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who played effectly that evening.
It could be the solution , avoid busy hours or days , do not bring your child with you , choose the right shop which has  park.
As an accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been doing camping for years and enjoy it very much.
I had always wanted to swim in the middle of sharks.
Well they didn't accepted when I pay with my Â£20 discount tiket  why?
Talking of my work, I had to mostly make the concert stage with some fellows.

By the way, on  14th of March  LONDON Fashion Show and Leisure show will hold at  Central Exhibition Hall.
On the other hand, it usually take much time to get what you exactly want .
Especially, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore.
Futermore, I am going to have  competition next year.
If I have  chance, I want to help  a concert again.
Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor  Danny Brook  would play in the show.
Despite I have enough money  shopping is not always enjoyable too, because I don't know which goods I will buy in the future.
Your time have been stolen.
In this moment Pat wished that she never would have been keen on knowing secrets!
I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day, we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm.
But Golf is an absolute new trial.
It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild.
To make the matter worse, I had expected the ticket with some discount, but when I went to the ticket box, there was no any discount available.
Additionally, 15% of students answered  they want the presentation lesson to be filmed.
We also have  " internet ", by which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute.
SO, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND OF ALL OR PART OF MY MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW.
I would prefer to live in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents.
I am therefore writing for a full refund and I expect to receive by post a cheque for Â£20.
We suggest to visit the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus.
Also, may I take a friend with me ,

From my point of view, it is great that science and technology improve for our life.
Below I  am clarifying some information you asked about.
There was no discount at all  which is in contrast with 'Discounts Availabe'.
I think that it is all what I would like to know.
I would highly recommend this building, because not only you can only enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors.
Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at  you'll also earn some money.
I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
I hope you understand my complains.
I know that before but I thought that he may change.
As I was a champion of  swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practice my skills.

First of all, the poster told me that this show was performed by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there was different actor.
I know that I will need sports equipment such as ; tennis shoes, a few sport shirts and shorts.
The show was called "Over the rainbow" and should be, in refer to the advertisment, London's newest and best musical show.
We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret, not to tell anyone.
I am writing to complain about a musical show called 'Over the rainbow , that took place in the Circle Theatre.
The 70% of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students , attending this lesson, are not only excited but also very active.
It would be nice to have a chance to try  new sport when we are relaxed.
It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and after  few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band, then I can go back home when I want, listening  the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car.
Before I was in a basketball team and I enjoyded  a lot.
I didn't want to play outside games with my friends .
I would like to sing and  photograph , I've done a course about photography and I think that I am very good on it.
To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts  as you advertised.
I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show.
My summer holidays last for two months, but I just have time in July.
On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written on your programme.

The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I had not recieved the explanations why.
I am really glad for  reciving the first priec in your competition ,
I will be very plesant joining the holliday.
I was spending some days in London and enjoyed a lot the idea of seeing this show.
The most exciting experience was that I could met a lot of people.
As we all know, technology had a gigantic improvement over the last 20 years, and today, it affects us in many ways.
As well as you can understand  I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money for a nonsense thing.
I am not satisfied with your show as it was compeletly different from  advertisement.
Should I take some clothes for  cold weather?
And it is even more difficul to predict how the clothes of the future will look like.
Thank you for asking about my latest good experience , I  let you know what the important details were.
I am so happy to have won this first prize in your competition.
What I decided to do was getting into the house by climbing up the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked.

After that she told me , that the man was the boy , which she met.
In the other hand, you cannot stay quiet for 2 week as some new inventions come out every day.
I would be please if you  give me some more information about the accommodation, and some advices about the cloth ( shal) I should wear and how much money I should take with me.
Without the development of modern technology, it may take your several years to reach the destination.
I'd suggest you to visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment.
On the last day we are going to have about three hours free times.
It would never happen in my country I must say.
 I am glad to provide all  information
We have no experience but we  like to learn this game.
What does  means  the world "shopping"?
Suddenly, the theft signal came into.
The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall  the 14th of March from 10.00 to 19.00.
we have  tecnology for cook, for work, for study, well hardly for everything.
In what day  i can start my travel?
Off course, if we had such pretty forne like yours, we would wear it with pleasure.
After all   they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets.
In addition, the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half  hour later, until 20:15.
When I do shopping I don't think about any problems I have.
Before I bought my ticket and booked train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot  good reviews about that show and I thought it was a great moment to share with friends.
It is somenthing very particular , its  paviment made from many small pecis of wood , its windows  with many colours ,
I would like to know how is the weather in California during the summer to bring with me  appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know , is the amount of money that I have to bring with me.
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPEMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIOUS  CATHEGORY.
I want to join swimming and tennis courses.
How much money  I need and if I have to have them in cash or I can use a credit card .
For sailing, well, I haven't try it before , that is why I want to have a try.
Even before you will find a color you like or the right size of the trousers, you were looking for it a long time, has gone!
I was exhausted when the concert finished ,
anyway it has been one of my best experience and I'll remember  for life.
Technology  has been improved by human being rapidly.
When booking  a airline, we can just simply make a phone to any agency, and get it done in one minute.
Also the amount of money I need to bring ( is there any shops).
Therefore, I would like to ask you for refunding me my entrance fee, as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement.
But from another point of view, it is silly to be earning money and don't spend it as you want.

We  see , the objects will come smaller.
At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand   other friends.
Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and there was playing another one.
I was not satified with the show at all because it was very different from the information your advertisement had stated.
The show had to started at 19:30 and I arrived before, frightened  not to find a good place to see "my hero".

We have it already discussed and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students a very keen ongoing.
The horrible thing about this is , I'm still in heaven, but  out with the wrong person, because Pat mixed the persons with their names.
For activities  we should film sport lessons because we always do something new.
Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year.
It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk free,  there are no teatchers ,
it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons.
As you know, I was there to help for the good running of the concert and there was a lot of different things to do.
A pop concert had ten pop bands.
It's not that problem that there was no more discount available - but  I had choosen it, because I'm ( alowed?)

Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy a tickets and when I apeared infrant of  casses I found out that the cost of  tickets on your advertisement and  real price wasn't the same,  real price was much higher.
In my opinion, one of the best things of the last Festival was that there were not only concerts .
For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as  on papers.
Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday.
I received your letter this morning and I was very suprised  it.
She didn't learn a lot but she knew all  important things.
Pat sent to my house a fax with the different alternatives she thought  but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the sorprise was ended.
The main advantage of modern technology is getting more informations in  shorter time.
On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person.
Finally, she couldn't wait and  wear to talk to Pat.
I would prefer to have accommodation in  log cabins because I like to be comfortable and I don't like to  be lied down on the floor inside a tent.

Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant  which was recommended in the advertisement , however, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation  which I thought was very unprofessional.
I was responsible to the advertisments and I had also to invite the "important persons" from our governement.
It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunatelly it was closed.
For exemple, if the shop is full of people,  is not enjoyable, because they will create too  confusion, too  noise with the risk of leaving time.
I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or and excurcion it won't be the same if I slept in a cabin.

As it is said in your advertisement , the show is starring Danny Brook but there was  different actor .
Last month, I went to a pop concert with four bands .
It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell anything to the teachers, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise.
However it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more , it is very fashionable those times.
My work consisted in checking the tickets,  the number on them and taking the people to their seats.
It is recommended that  should be filmed about Maths, English study skills, make brain up and a part of playing football.

But how  it affect to my daily life?
Lastly, your theatre restaurant had been closed already when the show was finished, because the time of  begining of the show was late.
Secondly, I want to stay in  log cabin.
How about the clothes of people , a hundred years later?
I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others .
But for me it is better , when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think , before I have to queue for half an hour I buy nothing!
Second, I prefer log cabins than tents.
Every aspect of my life is being constantly influence by achievements of science and technology - health, work, household, interaction with other people, etc.

There you will find a modern building with two different doors  a red  and a blue one.
All your  stuffs will be performed by the computers.
It isn't easy giving an answer at this question.
I have got a few things to complain about  your theart.
On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and diner for the band.
The party will be formal, therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress.
To sum up, I believe your advertisement completely misled .
And you can see the their clothes also.
- In the swimingpool we could been in the water and doing a party of water-polo and then Allan could done acrobatics stands, because he  make competitions.
I have been imagining where another contries are like England.

Would you mind giving some answer  whether I need some clothes and money at the Camp?
Her mother get angry but some hours later she was friendly again.

I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out in the weekend due to my work in the weekday so that I had time to go and did not have to care about the ticket price.
As far as I know, English people are really surprised about  Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as the knowledge in politics.
Waiting for your to write back
But in the show, there was  a another actor.
As you know, I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked  as a director's assistant during the last week.
The whole show and  acting was an profeccion like scholl theatre.
I also extremely hated those people who stood there all the time.
I prefer to stay in a tent as I go campping every summer and am used to slipping in tents.
As you need more information, I answer all your questions with plesuare.
It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement.
First, I am afraid but I can travel only in July.
Next day, I went to school as usual and got agog at a large number of girls waiting for me around my rocker.
In addition  this, today companies can do nothing without a computer.
- Funny plays and films to spend the break time;
Another disappointing point was that I wanted to watch Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show, but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him.
I look forward to meeting each other soon.
People have seen in the last 10 years how diferent our clothes had become to.
finally, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of  time it isn't enjoyable!
For example, I was born knowing the man has stepped on the moon.
Regarding the activities  I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, but I expect the water to be as crystal clear.
I mean, it is too crowdy,
you have to wait such a long time before you can pay, and mostly all the things are too expensive!
I'm looking forward to hearing soon from you.
It seemed that all people,  audience, the band and  stuffs were delightful.
 In conclusion, in the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve .
The show had to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided having supper was closed, without  saying the reason.
That was very  disapponted.
Computer will take a important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in the computer we would buy whatever we want.

Hope hearing from you.
I would like also to know how much money I can bring.
I haven't writen a letter to you for ages.
With a computer  however, all this is done in the matter of seconds.

I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in a high place since I was young.
But I feel the word of "International" was not really suit; because you just only got six countrie's stars and artists came.
Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wearing pub-wears to it, as it is suitable for dancing.
