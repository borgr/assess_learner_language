It was very unprofessional of you to have advertised the wrong star name in the paper.
I can go on the Internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones.
I was doing different activities , from designing fliers to selling tickets.
For example, for our jobs , special ceremonies , and so on.
Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money on yourself or people you like is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.
Anyway, the most important thing was that I had a good experience.
When I was in high school I used to be a member of the campfire.
After that it was suggested we visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed!
I knew I could not make any movement for my safety but I did and to my surprise it runsran away.
I would like to ask what kind of clothes I should wear there?
I do not agree that it is preferable to phone  the shop and give them a list of items you need instead of going to the shop and choosing whatever you want.
With reference to the information that you have requested, the hotel that has been booked is the Holiday Inn, in New Port and to get to the University of Wales , which is not far from the hotel, you only need to take a diversion where it's clearly indicatedmarked Carleon and once  you are on the main road , all you need to do is to follow the country road which takes you directly to the place.
How poor their imaginations are!
The majority of them said it's a good idea to do something about Maths and English study skills.
Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent but the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk.
I read your advertisement five days before, and I was really impressed by it.
Can you imagine you and your friends going on a picnic to the Moon with a silvery skirt with astronaut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots?
I'm very happy to receive some news from you.
But  happened the oppositethe opposite happened.
To conclude, although you can have good times while shopping all of us know that it is not always enjoyable, is it?
At home, there are fewer rules.
Especially, entry is free for students!
We would suggest just not going shoppingnot going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, and everything else could stay the same.
Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts to be available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price published in the advertisement.
Finally, I would like to ask you to give me some money back.
Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in the shopping centre  that you can't move  forwards or backwards.
On that date, I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in the musical show.
Everything is faster, and sometimes technology goes so fast that I'm unable to follow it.
Finally, I helped them  and in return I had a good experience as well as enjoying listening to the music.

You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small so that the people couldn't even dance at classical concerts.
Use the equipment and space that we have to organise some activities.
And I became even more angry when I had to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin.
As if this were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse.
At first, I was a bit scared, I mean , I was afraid of not being good enough to do well as an assistant; but finally everything went well.
I found my parents sitting in an armchair.
Everybody likes it , from a child to an old lady in her sixties , but it is not always enjoyable.
Some of  them I am really interested in , especially painting.
Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount and the advertisement mentioned that a discount was available.
I am writing to explain some aspects of your show.
The old man and woman tried to get her to stay in their house, but they couldn't.
On the other hand I worked very hard because the concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the hall and you can't imagine how dirty the fans are!
I will not make trouble but I ask you politely for my money back.
- in profit and each of us took 400 .
I'll tell you more about the experience in my next letter.
I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together  next year.
I hope you'll get much bigger concert halls next year.
As regards your questions, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am a student and my summer holiday will start on 27th June so I can go to the U.S.A in July and I prefer staying in tents because I have never experienced camping in a tent.

Finally,   life in France is crazy, this is the tradition.
After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead of staying in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be served for us.
But I was sure he would say nothing.
With all the dissatisfaction above, therefore, I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it should have been.
As you told me in your last letter , you were talking about rules in your class and you wanted to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home.
Then, even if we could enter  the theatre, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expected.
Also in the advertisement it says  that the show would begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15; that meant that I had to cancel a date that I had at 21:00, because I couldn't make it.
When I have a headache I eatswallow pills, made by technology.
I think we should book  the Palace Hotel.
What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall.
Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, went home, and locked herself in her bedroom.

I refer to your advertisement in the Herald Tribune where you advertised  the Circle Theatre and the recent musical: Over the Rainbow.
I couldn't change his mind although I tried everything.
If I watch TV too much I might not speak to my family very often.
I'm writing to give you the information you requested.
Now none of Pat's friends tell her about their secrets because Pat isn't very good at keeping secrets.
I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play "Over The Rainbow" and I must say that I was rather disappointed.
Afterwards, when I have my breakfast, I use my toaster for my bread and, as I want  hot milk, I use my modern cooker too.
I just want to know  what I will have to pay for myself.
The plays and films were really wonderful . People liked them very much, so could you have more next year
Maybe they like shopping on the Internet or window shopping ; it doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like.

I suppose you know about the "Portugal Pop Concert" that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month, don't you?

When you need to buy something you have to look for the best price, which is always a work of time, and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper, it could be crowded.
People will prefer to wear comfortable clothes, even to go to the office.

To sum up, although there is certainly a good side to shopping, such as the pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for a long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.
 I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience of sleeping close to  nature.

Now I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter.
However, we promised our parents to do some cleaning  every week.

I think then we should film an information-technology lesson.
In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner.
From the activities you've offered I want to do golf and surfing.
I received your letter, so I am writing to you to give you some information about me.
It was a real joy to receive your letter and I still can't believe it.
However, people can't have a good time even on weekdays while shopping.
I am really surprised by the information that I won, and I would like to say  thank you for everything .
And on Wednesday morning we go to the National Art Gallery, and after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon.
We thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformations  nowadays in England concerning fashion, leisure, sports and lifestyle.
On the other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card.
QualityThe quality of life is very low.
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven wonders of the world, I knew  I had to see it.
The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual level of activity all over the house.
Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing that has ever happened in their lives.
And please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes I will have to bring?
If not, what do you suggest?
So I would like to do these two activities while I am at the Camp.
But I enjoy finding out about new activities!
On top of everything, the main actor, Danny Brook, did not appear in the show.
I had a week's holiday in London, so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure, however it was the worst evening in my life.
The countless fascinating things will definitely take you the whole day to appreciate.
On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us with support in our hard tasks and setting us free to apply our intelligence and efforts to more important things.
Some concert halls were really small so that there was bad air and not enough room for everyone and you could not enjoy anything!
I think that these kinds of people have a poor life because they can never live quietly because peopleeverybody knows them and wants to know a lot of things about them.
As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do, but I decided to take swimming and photography, because I am very good at swimming and because I am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitting clothes , taking off and putting on.
In contrast to the advertisement everything was disappointing.
Just imagine the future people's way of life .
It began 45 minutes later than it should have .
In my countrycountry's schools we are not allowed to have an argument with classmates and are not allowed to eat in class.
Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend I take.
Besides, I really would like to know  approximately how much money I should take with me .
Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her classmateclassmates and she ran away as fast as she could.
I'd rather sleep in a tent because I want to enjoy this wild experience!
And the restaurant of the theatretheatre restaurant was being paintpainted, so I could not go there advertisement.
So that's why they have invented the telephone.
At that point, even if Danny Brook had been there as the advertisement announced, it couldn't have been a more disappointing evening.
I am sure you can understand this.
Last of all, it says in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made.
Finally, I am wondering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need.
About the accommodation, from the two options, I choose to sleep in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
Firstly, I expected to see a performance by Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor.
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximately one mile away.
It's connected with our house, our workplace  etc.
In the tale "It's a good life", the author gives much more emphasis to  Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story.

The first thing that disappointdisappointed me was the star.
So I was suspended, I had a fight with one of my best friends, all because she wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
After having thought about this video and asked various people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take up a great part of a day at school; this being in three parts.
I asked my mom and my friends and nobody knew where it was.
WELL, THE TWO ACTIVITIES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CHOOSE ARE BASKETBALL AND SINGING.
Thank you in advance for your comprehensionunderstanding and we look forward to hearing from you.
If we used them, we would be sent to the head office of the school.
Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before  that enjoying yourself like this  could be weird.
It also allows me to write to my friends by e-mail.
And is it better to have cash or cheques?
I couldn't write to you because I was very busy.
I can hardly wait for your reply!
AFTER THE MEETING RECEIVED ALLWE ALL RECEIVED THE SAME CLOTHES.
I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in a log cabin.
, What is your name, house, dog, cat, boy, girls etc . I am very happy that I promised  myself that I would learn Spanish this Summer at  Huntingdon College.
At first my favourite actor Danny Brook didn't perform , without any explanations being given, and the show should have started at 19:30 instead of 20:15!!
I couldn't stand wearing a suit or kit like that which has been shown in Starwars!
In my opinion we must spend more time on more interesting things than shopping , like sport, reading, chatting about ideas which make our lives better.
I can play basketball well, because I used to practiseplay basketball, when I went to the club every Saturday.
Finally, I think it was a good idea  buying only one ticket for all the events since I  spent the time watching and enjoying all of them.
However, the technology never stops, we always search for new things because we are made to compete, discover, think of things which we don't know.
According to the advertisement, the show which I had gone to was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15.
Now I will give you the information which you asked for.
You should return my money immediately because that night was far from perfect.
First of all, in my opinion, TV has a great educational function, and it also makes the world  smaller.
This class teaches you how to organise what you want to write.
The first time, when I saw the advertisement in the newspaper, I really appreciated it.
In  addition , when you organize  next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films ?
But the party was great after all.
In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is a waste of time.
After entering , you will see the conference room which will be signposted.
Firstly, I would like to inform you that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in any other month.
Personally, I do think televisions are the most important invention.
Suddenly, I heard a cry of " Help, help" in the distance.
You can walk to the top of the tower and it gives you a beautiful view.
Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else they want!
I never triedhave never tried surfing in my life but I am a very good snowboarder and this could be an advantage.
" I'm very unhappy that I have to write you this letter.
One of my favourite books is without doubt  Wuthering Heights , a famous book written by Emily Brontë.
First of all, I was surprisingsurprised that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not playperform.
When shopping, we don't need to wait for the cashier to take every article's note by hand.
In the big room where we'll have the party, there'll be some pictures of our college .
In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become irritable because I can't find anything.
Even if the photographs taken are modest work, I am really interested in this activity.
We had been told that discounts on the ticket prices were available but on the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered.
I WAS PART OF THE STAFF .
Why is it everything that was on the candidates was wrong and different from what we experienced.
First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own life private, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce or a family member's or  closest friend's death.
And also, it wrotesaid that  discounts were available but they were not.
Last weekend, I was in London with my friend and I saw your musical show "over the Rainbow".
To begin my complaint I might start with the actor - who was a different one to the one advertised, not Danny Brook.
As soon as the arrangements for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her best friend.
So I think you'd better wear a dress.
In conclusion, don't forget that a job is just done in your "spare" time.
What kind of clothes should I put in my case?
I am writing to you to give you some required information.
That's why I'd like to feel adventurous.
Usually if you ask them what they  desire most, the answer is: "I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do .
Thank you for the letter that confirmed first prize.
You'll  agree with me that 45 minutes waiting for the start of the show is too long a time.
Regarding accommodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in a tent as I believe that is the right type of accommodation for going camping .
That is  the second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning and lasts until 19.00.
Therefore I wouldn't change anything in my home life  or in my school life.
Technology creates for me a lot of new possibilities every day, and it also makes everything easier.
Technology is the future, and the present.
I also would like to remark that this change does not increase the cost of the trip, because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students.
My second task was  to look in all the fans' bags to confiscate "dangerous" items . I saw really funny things like toothbrushes in the bags.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON.
Finally, I give you some suggestions which could take about 3 hours in the national museum in my area.
Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work.
First of all, I want to thank you for the interesting programme  which you have already organised.
Suddenly, she heard a manman's voice calling her : "Sara...Sara.. look down to the river."
If you are used to going  Shopping very often, maybe it is because you don't know about all the other good things you can do on your weekend.
The uniform  we wear has to be perfect.
Firstly, the actors were different from the ones  in the advertisement , which was very disappointing for me.
First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation being given.
After all this, I want to know if I will get some money back.
Another bad thing is that people want some things very badly, and they can't afford them.
We would like our money back , please , because everything went wrong . The atmosphere totally changed!
I was so excited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band about.
First of all, the performers should have been Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
You should be punctual when coming to the dining table, respectful, do your homeworkshomework and watch TV less and not too loud.
If you say that the wage is far from satisfactory, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher.
We would be very interested in seeing  English fashion.

She spent the money  on a magazine.
I helped with setting up the sound equipment, programming the light system on the computer, and tidying up Madonna's room!
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows at the "Circle Theatre".
Firstly, the material of which clothes are made is of a wide variety.
Because  although they are famous they also have their private life.
After the show I went to the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed.
Thank you for your letter, as usual, it's a pleasure to receive  news from you.
The advertisement outside the theatre described a lot of interesting things to enjoy.
In the advertisement, you mentioned actors, time,  discount and facilities.
If you need any more information, please let me know.
However, it was closed because it was being decorated.
I also helped to serve people who would like to drink .
Will you give me some pocket-money during the trip ?
I want to know some information about it.
I phoned  the police and told them the whole story.
I prefer to stay in log cabins rather than in tents, because log cabins have  structure, that I need to stay for a few days.
The dance shows were a sight for our sore eyes ;
In the end everything depends on our attitude to life, including shopping.
Molly, Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good-bye to each other as, to Molly, they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they had been dating, she wanted them to enjoy their  time together.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NEW  HOUSE?
I hope that coming after julyJuly won't disturb  Camp California's plans for me.
Functions' clothes are the way to love animals!
We are all very interested in the show because English people have a different kind of life.
The Internet is very handy, you can shop, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, which is really funny.
Every one hopes to enjoy himself and come back with a lot of knowledge.
So we suggest puttingdoing things this way on Tuesday 14 : in the morning go to the Science Museum and , instead of shopping, we could attend the London Fashion Show, because there will be the latest fashions, leisure wear ,  sportswear, make-up, and hair styles, and as you know , we love all those topics, and it's a great opportunity while we are in London.
I learned swimming at the age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming.

If you're tired, the pill can give you vitamins, proteins and make you refreshed
I have just received your letter telling me I have won the first prize in your competition, and I am glad about it.
I would like to know what sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary.
Another point is that now you don't need to go out  shopping.
I spent two days at the International Arts Festival you organized.
When the show finally started I found out that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor.
Plays and films  were good, there weren't enough.
About accommodation I would prefer a cabin, because I suffer from allergicallergies, and I think a tent  would not be very suitable for my health.
I'm writing to you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play at your theatre.
We can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hairstyles which we will learn about next term.
The two activities that I prefer are Basketball, because I  played in my school's team for almost a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I practisehave practisedhave done since I was ten.
I believe there are a lot of ways to enjoy shopping.
The restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity .
For August, I have already made another appointment with my friends.
They look like  robots who have to do their duty - to buy.
I used to be the photographer on family holidays and I know how a camera works.
In fact, I had.
I can't believe she said that  I was at  Maria's party and , because  I was distracted, I told Pat that I had lost  Jon's shirt.
The show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00.
First of all I'd prefer to travel in July, because it is the only month I have free.
The only effect on me is more frequent disagreements with my parents.
I would also like to thank you for the excellent programme you organized for us, and in particular the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating.
Recently, I had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to your theatre to see "Over The Rainbow" and I was really disappointed.
Peter got very angry and asked Pat why had theythey had said that to him.
Then, I discovered some points and I am writing to give my suggestions and recommendations.
We have had a quite pleasant time except for that evening.
And we have two ways to get to the conference, a bus or a train.
A few days before, I had found a little window at the back of the building, so I entered in this way and by chance I just arrived in the money'smoney roomvault.
Pat and Ted  always had competition, and Ted used to be the best . He had never failed and people in general customs liked Ted more . I don't know why.
My wife and I went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook.
I would like to stay in a log cabin because I have had bad experienceexperiences with tents.
It is very nice when you can do your shopping like that.
Everyone has his own style but it's obvious that many of us are wearing the same clothes as others.
I think it was definitely not the perfect evening  guaranteed in your advertisement.
In addition to this , some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there for the occasion and, personally speaking , I think the show could be done in the open air next year, so that the music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around.
Thank you for your letter  asking for my help with the conference.
However, it would not have been such a great problem if the show   had proved to be as good as they promised but it really was not worth seeing, especially because the main actor was not Danny Brook , whom we expected , but an unknown, clearly an inexperienced young actor, named Tom Douglas.
I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held on 21st and 22nd November.
( it wasn't easy to decide which activities I will do, because almost every choice interested me)
I'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent.
Because you have to visit many shops and see many things.
I was pleased when I got it.
But the best thing that we do, when we go shopshopping is spend  time having lunch at a snack bar, watching movies and playing computer games.
One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall as usual.
It must be very exhausting to have the media around you day and night because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character.
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing tour.
To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars and politicians have a right to one.
You won't believe how many famous people I knewmet.
I kept asking myself ' Should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to help with him.
I would like to go only in July because I have had my holidays booked for that month since last January.
For example, putting the music on too highloud when my sister is working.
I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to practisedo new ones, if it is possible.
Finally, I'd like to practiseplay tennis and to try climbing.
It contains lots of  archaeological Etruscans founded and some remains from the Estruscans' necropolis.
I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait in a big queue to be attended by the teller, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.
As I was so looking forward to seeing Danny's performance, I was very disappointed.
Also I like to play tennis, which is a beautiful "game" itself and good for the figure.
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a great success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet.
I am writing to answer  your invitation which I have received as a first prize winner.
After the show, my friends and I decided to go to your restaurant, but we were amazed to find it closed.
It takes 25 minutes , which is convenient for us.
I was training to be a personal assistant to Madonna herself.
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using.
I never triedhave never tried surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find it magical.
I think this side of the question is balanced because before the effect on our health was less than it is now.
Write back to me soon and tell me about your impression of the story (I mean if you enjoyed the story or not!)
And how much money am I going to need to have there with me?
We would like to go in July, because my wife Catrin just has holidays next month.
On the other hand, I cannot sing very well but I would like to do this activity there.
I have received your letter , which  makes me happy.
I am looking forward to hearing from you
Every day, the growth of  modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody's life.
In my daily life I can save time, but I think everybody should use the the time he has saved for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a "natural life" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots.
I'm excited to be going on holiday there and , thanks to you, I will realize a dream I've always had.
I'll tell you the two activities I chose.
It has absolutely reduced women's  housework time.
We don't have old-fashioned rules or anything like that.
Last week I spent my holiday in London and I saw your musical "Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed.
To answer  our first question about where I would prefer to sleep, I prefer tents because they are closer to nature and I like sleeping in sleeping bags (=BV bags).
I know you have  good taste in presents!
So the whole fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful, practical and comfortable.
In reference to the date of  travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at  University and I only have July to take my holidays.
I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there are many challenges in your new career.
Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and the risk of flooding will also rise.
Modern technology has changed livesour daily lives a lot.
So I would like to travel in July.
It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London, since several things didn't work out as promised in your advertisement.
First of all, I congratulate you on organising this kind of event.
The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of choicechoices which  I like.
Because human height won't change so much, unless 10000 years have passed.
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I  realised that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went to the show , had been replaced by another actor, who couldn't sing  half as well as Brook.
It was a pop concert with lots of famous singers like Madona, Julio Iglesias, and people like them
I decided to go to see this show because of its stars, but on the day I saw it, a different actor performed.
I've just helped  the staff.
What are you doing nowadays ? How is your school?
Or would our house itself be alive?
Finally, I am writing to request a full refund for my friends and me, because I felt your advertisement was misleading.
But last week we saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
I was very pleased to receive your letter.
They get everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future.
Everyone likes sales, but those so-called sale items are not really good value.
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come true.
However, we would like to suggest  something:
Before that , you have to think about why you need to earn money and how you do that.
Suddenly, my father realised he had forgotten to lock the car.
After, a student will make a speech about what he or she has learned ,
AND AM I ALLOWED TO BRING MY DOG WITH ME?
Well, I'm also bothered about what's going on around me but  have you forgotten about newspapers?
According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisingly,  was performed by a different actor whom I didn't even know the namewhose name I didn't even know.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can take my holiday onlyonly take my holiday in July.
However, I managed to listen to the music and I must admit that I liked it.
I would  choose the month of July, because I'm free at this time from family duties.
What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear on the stage at all.
You advertised  my perfect evening out.
I started training in 1996, and I have never given it up.
He cured the bird  with love, and the bird was able to fly.
In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which might disturb my family.
It was about Marine, who was our close friend.
Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked  for the group's accommodation and I spoke with the hotel manager about travelling to the conference.
You ask me for some information - here it is.
We think that the show might be a great opportunity for  most of us who are interested in fashion and leisure.
Bye and think about this.
houses will only be more modern and more practical but not very different from our homes in the present.
But they don't consider the problems the rumours may cause the famous family or couple.
I was just 15 years old.
But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes expensive and I can't afford them.
Therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum , which is really fascinating.
Modern technology has brought us many inventions which have made our daily lives much easier.
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husbands too.
By problems I mean  that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts available?
Secondly, I supposedthought the show would start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
Sometimes I am alone all  day but I have contact with many people.
Anyway, what you wanted to know was what my job was.
It is a become truedream come true and was really unexpected for me!
What a fool I was.
I am very happy about the news.
- Some sequences featuring the gym lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that shows how the children have their lunch and spend their free time, what games they play in the schoolyard and how they interact with each other.
Maria was nervous, but , for the first time, she could talk to him as she never had before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person in the world . She had her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back ; after all, everything happened because of her.
Furthermore, this party will be in your hotel as in the previous years.
I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in the States.
Two days before , her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to divorce . Maria was so upset that she couldn't keep it to herself.
It is more comfortable and I am afraid of wild animals.
I have already  seen other versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor, who ended with the musical.
In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey conducted among the students of our school.
At the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel.
I would like to travel in July because I have got my summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August.
It was very well organised . The show started  exactly on time and the group  performed well too.
We will need our imagination  to answer these questions but we will never know the right answer.
In fact I have been playing the piano for a children's choir for 5 years.
It is fantastic.
JUST FOR EXAMPLE, THE INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I just had no way to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there.
I stood up in front of the audience and I gave them attention.
What do you take us for, Mr Smith?

You are choosing Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend."
The place where we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days  setting up the stage, the equipment, and the lights.
Another thing is that the discounts weren't available although I had read about them earlier in your advert.
How could you change the actors without saying something to the audience.
Because of all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definitely one of the worst.
Some people are in a hurry , others are aggressive and most of the others are very stressed.
I am not very good at painting, but I choose it because it is a good opportunity to practisedo it.
in factIn fact all the audience were very disappointed.
That is a question  which many people ask themselves and other people quite often.
Pat was not a very clever teenager and while she was attending  Secondary School she had many problems with Chemistry.
And I checked his physical condition.
I am writing to give you my details and ask for some more information.
I hope I've answered all your questions and I would be pleased if mine could also be answered.
Then, the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.
When he comescame back home, he was surprised because Maria was more angry than before.
It is a show about the latest fashions, leisure and sportswear, make-up and hairstyles.
The second activity is more of a hobby.
Have you ever thought about a world without the phone?
But the most important thing to enjoy shopping is not to spend all the money which you have.
I was really happy when your letter arrived and I knewlearned that I won the first prize in your competition.
We live in a small and old-fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: losing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died , terrified by the darkness which was nearing.
One of them was about her boss's private life: he had  an illegitimate son.

A different actor appeared instead of him.
 I had the pleasure of listening to your variety of concerts.
They are gonna showgoing to show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and new hairstyles.
On 5th of May , which was a national holiday in Japan, I had a part-time job at a pop concert in the Tokyo Dome.
Despite this shopping culture, shopping is not always enjoyable .
I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction with your perfect organisation.
How has modern technology changed your daily life?
It is a really good programme, and in particular visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery would be a great opportunity to learn about art and the the latest advances in science.
The cities are the main commercial centres, our streets are full of billboards advertising many things , as does TV either.
She told  Pat that she didn't want any other people to know about it except her.
It is popular with the students.
She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tried to get rid of him with the help of false accusations.
What else, unless they pass the exam they have to have extra lessons or tests.
Secondly, I would like to stay in a tent because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can.
I am a good defender.
Which was really great , and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want.
I have been swimming for a club for 8 years and enjoy it a lot.

When I went  to see her play, I really would love to be an actress.
I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in the flesh.
I paid the same as a person who bought the tickets ten minutes before the performance.
I am pleased to have received your letter that informed me that I have won the first prize in your competition.
It was a perfectly terrible evening out.
I think it will be great and I want to try it.
It is rare that schools  don't have a multimedia centre with many computers for the students to use.
Technology has brought simple solutions to my life.
I was shocked because I had already spoken with them and I had got two autographs.
I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you for a refund for the amount I paid, or part of it.
Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and another girl.
I also suggest that more plays and films should  take place.
Although my parents were very happy about having such a special opportunity of visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.
She was so frightened and sad that she had no energy.
They are a bit far from town but they have huge car parks.
Everybody likes to be with their family without any reporter or photographer hanging around.
which  special place in the town  will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there , like a big supermarket  and mall centre , from different areas of the city.
First the telegraph and the radio and now TV, the telephone and the Internet allow people to be in contact with others really quickly , and distances aren't now so difficult  to overcome.
Lastly, about the ticket . The advertisment said ' Discounts Available' but no way , I had to pay the full £ 20.00 and the restaurant was closed because of rebuilding or something.
I really enjoyed serving the drinks to the pop-stars.
Secondly, I actually liked the Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much.
Baking is my passion and in the town where I live I'm known for making the best cakes in the area.
OK, write to me soon, huge hug and kisses
I am writing to thank you for the first prize in your competition and to reply to your letter.
Firstly, I can take my holiday only in the first two weeks of July because of my work.
Therefore, I strongly recommend that you invite artists and stars from more than six countries and build larger concert halls.
Nowadays  modern technology is advancing and it is really affecting our daily life.
Definitely we should try to understand technology .
If we know how to use it, technology will improve our way of life.
I arrived in Ireland on 2nd July.
And yet  he was too weak to resist the rats  coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death.
If you have any ideas about bigger halls, it would be better.
It is a very common phenomenon these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something.
He has a best friend, who was more like a brother to him.
When we enterentered the place our problems began.
I recalled all the answers and I have written this article.
People buy and buy unnecessary things but, when they arrive in their housesget home, they can see an empty wallet.
To sum up, there are both positive and negative aspects to  modern technology, because it can make our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us.
I am lucky if I find something which fits.
This went on and on, got more and more serious , but it was so secret that the teachers didn't notice.
From my point of view I can complain only about the small concert hall and the fact there were artists from only six countries.
This is the most terrible disadvantage technology has.
My confession caused a disaster in her life and that of her family, and they called the police to take me off of the planet or to be arrested, so that I couldn't see her again.
Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days at the festival - Saturday and Sunday.
We try to play  many instruments, and sing even if we don't know how.
On the positive side, if I am bored, the first thing that I want to do is watch television or listen to music.
It happened to me once .  I wanted to go on holiday, so I went to the travel agency.
Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free changing room and waste  time putting on some clothes when in the end they are not the right size.
In other words, what they will suggest  is very interesting to us . I mean it conflicts with your plan . What a pity!
I'm a beginner at both activities.
For all these reasons I  wish that I  not hadhad not gone to see that show, for which the tickets were not available.
To make my ideas profitable my parents lived in a small village near  wonderful countryside.
One thing you have not told me is whether I have to pay for everything myself in California or not.
You can imagine how upset we were and we ask you for  some compensation for the night that we spent at your theatre.
I was really delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize.
Yes, there is a big plus with a big store of course.
There are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
When we are bored and lonely or on the other hand when we are tired of doing something we dislike.
Because my summer holidays   start at the end of June.
This secret was an opportunity for Pat to be the best without any competition but it was a secret that involved his best friend's sexuality, and if Ted had been a normal person it would have been fine but he was an example for all the school.
Now, I will answer your questions.
For example, on the leaflet it was written that there would be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries.
Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs . Will those women still think shopping is enjoyable!
In short, the Amusement Centre is a fascinating place and it deserves a visit.
Furthermore, I would like to know exactly what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money I should expect to spend there.
But at golf I am a beginner.
Referring toRegarding accommodation I would rather stay in a tent because I have never been  camping and I would like to try it.
I hope you consider these  suggestions.
I worked as a receptionist in the VIP room and I needed to look very happy  all the time, which wasn't very difficult.
The other thing is I don't like going shopping on the weekend.
Visitors could learn plays with professionals.
Living better, people live longer and it is necessary to produce more food, but more food means chemical agents on the earth, the circle never stops.
The stars and artists are from only six countries, and some concerts take place in small halls.
The accommodation that best suits me is the log cabin, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to having all my belongings in order and packed at all times.
Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to choose and why.
We asked for it and we were told that there was no discount either for her  or anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.
Unfortunately my parents did not realize how TV was playing a role among us.
Marc, one of my friends, hit Mr. Heyman with a bottle and he lost  consciousness.
You  also said in your letter that we will have  the chance to do two activities.
I think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
I'd prefer it if you gave me this information as soon as you can.
I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp .
By the way , my team and I won the last school championship .
I play guard on my team .
I also like tennis but I am not very good .
I was wondering if you could give me some lessons while I am there.
After all that , we can notice that shopping can be a good option as long as we can choose other enjoyable activities for our free time.
Her boss was a rich man, really rich.
I am writing to you because I felt disappointed after seeing the musical  "Over the Rainbow".
It was not until the concert that I became a pop maniac.
It started at 20:15, but it was said that it would start at 19:30.
Swimming I won last summer'sI won last summer's swimming competition in the school . Although I'm not very good at surfing I like it, and I always practise on my holidays every year.
I am good at timing on swimming.
I have just been staying in a tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interesting adventure.
First of all, the advertisement for the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage.
I look forward to hearing from you.
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary equipment for camping.
So it would be fine if you wore casual clothes and looked smart.
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depressed:
bringin fact, money and celebrity don't always bring happiness.
So why did you make this invitation?
It often begins with finding a parking space for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes.
I was very surprised at the result of the competition.
If this happens again I'll write to you to tell you more.
You can't imagine how fun it was!
and there is a very big park in the Castle.
Concerning the date when I would like to travel, it will be nice to go on the 1st of July .
I mean that you have to wait until the shop assistant comes to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy.
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities in our daily life at school should be filmed to give the other students an idea of what we usually do , not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time.
I would like to know what type of clothes I should wear there .
Would you check the weather forecast for me, please?
About the accommodation at camp, I prefer a tent because I love to sleep in tents .
It is more interesting than sleeping in log cabins.
By the way, why weren't any discounts available for the tickets, as  was promised in the advertisement?
I am writing this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening at your musical show "Over the rainbow" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director.
I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totally different.
In what follows, I would like to inform you that I've attendedI attended your new musical show, the name of which is "Over the rainbow", last Saturday evening, 10th June.
I WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY  TRAVELLING IN JULY BECAUSE I HAVE TO TAKE MY LITERATURE EXAMS BEFORE THEN AND I'M TAKING THEM IN JUNE.
The street is so crowded that you can't walk like you usually do and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lose them.
However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange small details.
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the tallest building in the world.
His voice is also soulful and sometimes even gave us blissful feelings.
The advertisement said it is taking place on Tuesday 14 March from 10am to 7pm.
First, as I am very fond of Danny Brook, I was surprised that he had totally changed his voice, face, and so on!
But the most important innovation in technological development is the computer.
I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practising new techniques and taking pictures of new landscapes.
You could try to do your shopping via the Internet.
Last week I had the chance to spend time in London and this is why I decided to go to the Circle Theatre to see the  show.
Last month, I helped out at a pop concert , which I really enjoyed.
Let me explain to you why I'm now so disappointed.
Everyone is welcome to join in with this party in order to get to know each other in a good atmosphere.
I would prefer to stay in a tent so that I will have the chance to be in contact with  nature as well as the scenery around the camp.
They decided to return to their father because he was old and he needed help.
To conclude, will you kindly let me know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me.
I walked in first with Pat and two of my friends.
Well I thought the opposite about a year ago but recently I have thought this because I see all the people going shopping and they don't realise that  outside in the real world there are poor people who need that money which they are only spending on material things .
You might put your money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know.
Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without any information or explanation being given by the management.
Since I'm coming in the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me ? And I have another question .
It's about money.
I strongly recommend  making a video about "Upper intermidiate" class.
I hope to hear from you as soon as possible and thanks for understanding my situation.
I'm writing  to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me.
First, I'd like to travel in July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto in August.
I believed in the phrase with which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!'
Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people)  consisted in carrying musical instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,...
I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than a log cabin.
Please would you  explain why this happened?
Last weekend we decided to go to the beach with Pat and Nick (her boyfriend).
The accommodation I would prefer to stay in is a tent because I like adventures and also I will have more contact with  nature.
It's evident that whatever we wear looks like clothes, and I think we should stop being so stupid.
Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or if everything is provided by the organisers.
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, or if something terrible has happened to me, I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box.
After the show I felt really hungry, so I intended to go to the restaurant , which occasionally was closed.
Secondly, you cannot rule out that you might get robbed by a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of how you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet .
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people in our class are going to work in this sector so it would be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education.
In addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10 .
This was excellent .
It meant people only spent pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weekend .
For them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
I understoodunderstand from your letter  that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me, including transport to and from the airport.
Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis as activities.
When I approached  the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone.
The music was excellent, the audience enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there,  ten metres from my favourite group.
On the one hand that's because they haven't enough money to pay for it and on the other hand it's because they can't move very well , for example if they are disabled.
She works as a model, and she was advising him about what clothes, etc,... to buy for her.
Quite recently, in my country electric bicycles have been invented.
I want to be a mother to them and a friend to them.
Secondly, the times, it's on at 14.30 and 19.30 so I chose 19.30.
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.
I hope this letter answeranswers all your questions, if you want to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter.
Actually I can't swim at all.
I would like to ask you what type of clothes I should bring?
Let me make it clear, you wasted my time and money.
I would like to say that I am not satisfied with it.
It was  my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts.
I chose this aisle because I thought it was quicker than the others.
So we had to rest for a while and had a drink.
Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can get involved during the camp.
For all these reasons, I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money  to my house.
To be honest, the next greatest invention of mankind, the computer, can't work  if you haven't got the phone.
As you know , we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
I don't know exactly what California's weather is like.
There are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
We will be learning at home using computers and discs.
Students who want home tutors are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and that means they take lessons after school, not in the daytime.
Could you tell me if you could lend me some equipment for photographyphotographic equipment?
I hope you understand me, and I ask for money back and I hope this won't happen again.
Nowadays, most products' prices have gone up with our own country's economic development.
There are a lot of folk stories from around the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia .
But as it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself.
But I like different styles of art.
Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent to sleeping in a log cabin because it is easier to clean.
Why can'tcan't famous people do all these things?
There are a lot of activities and lessons at our school, so I think it's difficult to choose some of them.
It was love at first sight and we were fascinated by the thought  of building  the same kind of organisation in our town.
It is the only month that I don't work.
In addition, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount.
I couldn't stand being watched and my fury led me straight to Pat.
Based on everything listed above, I would like to receiveget the £10  which I paid  back.
I am keen on photography so I would love to participate in this activity . I am very good at it and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others.
The night was terrible, but it could have been saved by a nice dinner in your restaurant, but it was closed because the heater was not working due to a leak.
In music, before I had a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them in my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I can just record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument , controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds.
Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with enough money to buy what you always wanted to.
If a student is ill, we will return the money but you should tell us  one week before we start.
Some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously . They gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
Concerning the activities that you have listed  .
In my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen.
Besides all those improvements and comfortcomforts I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us.
During my 2 weeks' holiday I wanted to attend a musical show.
I am writing to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre.
I spent a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother phoned Pat's mother and Pat's mother explained whole thethe whole story to my mother.
We were all given different sorts of jobs to do.
I will take my exams in June and have the results in August.
We could play with our toys, dolls and we could enjoy ourselves without a computer.
I'm writing this letter to tell you about my good experience at a pop concert, last month.
I had to go back to the hotel, because all the restaurants in the area were absolutelycompletely crowded.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for the prize I won.
When I am too tired to go out but want to meet some new people, computer technology provides me with the opportunity.
It looks nice and has a good message.
I will take the F.C.E at the University of Cambridge and other exams in several subjects at my high school.
Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of our human rights.
What is more, every place is explained in English.
Mankind became more and more clever and built wonderful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands.
However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and at the same time.
The second day's objective was to install the stage   lights, loudspeakers and all the other stuff.
But the only problem with the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00.
I was so surprised but so glad to read that I had won the first prize in your competition.
Most of the time when we go to the shopping centre we have a lot of fun . We go to stores to look at clothing, we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries, but is not enjoyable all the time.
Finally, I would like to ask you whether there is anything I should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
Also, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization.
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, which took place in your establishment, The Circle Theatre, which made me feel very upset.
People believe that the bird was sent from heaven.
Despite my appreciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I've chosen my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis.
Your dance shows are very beautiful, the art exhibition is something original and exciting.
The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because  entry to the show is free for students.
Thank you for your letter, which arrived on the second  of
If possible, could you let me know what I'll need , for example what clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend ?
But everything was terrible and different to your advertisement.
But Lily never tells her what she really wants and what she really thinks about  things.
It was a great pleasure to hear from you  that I have won first prize in your competition.
Science and technology can give us a better life stylelifestyle or better food.
I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show "Over the Rainbow", of which you are the manager.
The fourth day, the singers and the musicians were  there to test the equipment.
The day of the party everyone had fun , especially Pat who beginningto start with was sad.
The next task I was given was ironing costumes.
I also had to clean the washrooms.
I think that is everything I would like to know.
They make their lifestyle much easier and faster because they need to catch up with  other people.
There is an ambiguity about technology - it can create good things and terrible things as well.
At some lessons students are always working, but as we work, we joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life.
The festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists from only six counties they could be invited  from all over the world.
We bought tickets for the second show, which was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15!
Some people seem to enjoy going shopping and spending money .
It makes them happy . But what about the queues you have to join to pay for something just to find, when you get to the front, that they have to close the till and they ask you to move to the next till . What a waste of time.
Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, which would take a much longer time if it had to be found by traditional means.
If the telephone hadn't been invented, we wouldn't live as perfectly as nowadays.
They all did except one: Pat.
I don't reallyreally know what you should see ; I don't think three hours is enough but near the station there is a beautiful park , popular for its variety of flowers.
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE.
Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see  the famous Danny Brook act.
In addition to all this, the promised discounts on the tickets were not offered.
And the reason I choose painting is it's very exciting for me .
I am not very good at this subject but I will improve my painting.
Last month, I had a great time at the concert of "Dragon" , which is the most popular hard rock group in the world.
They use all of this because they want to do their work  and leisure activities with these helping kitsthe help of these devices.
I look forward to hearing soon.
It was an absolutely great idea.
Firstly, you spoke about two actors , Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad.
I received your letter asking for some information about the conference
I'm very happy to have won  your competition.
But some schools in my country don't allow a lot of things.
However , all the students are passive.
Another disappointing thing was that I could not get a student discount, even though your advertisement promised them.
We can't listen to music in class either.
I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressful , and very expensive one, too.
You asked me about an interesting building to visit.
Some people tried to enter without a ticket but they weren't allowed by the police.
It is an excellent price because when I am tempted to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money.
After having looked around the shops for 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for .
On the other hand, some companies offer special services , such as sending your order by  post or taking it on the telephone.
I am really pleased to hear from you  that I won the prize.
viewFrom my point of view, the Internet is the most important discoveryinvention of the 2000 century.
I'd like not only to complain but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't "perfect" as you advertised but it was a big disaster.
I was at the show at your theatre three days ago.
He was replaced by a novice actor who gave a very disappointing performance.
I have never slept in tents when I went camping.
In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat on the Internet..."
We just sat on our seats with nothing to do.
But it's also true that sometime we aren't able to take a step without it.
Every statement was wrong.
I also want to know if I can have  time for shopping.
But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day with my motherwith my mother looking through a huge department-store.
It will be a surprise!
In my opinion, shopping is relaxing , above all on Saturdays when you have finished a working week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday.
I don't really like staying in tents.
Since everyone can afford modern technology everyone's life in the more developed countries has changed completely.
The principal reason is the cheap price.
I have schoolteachers about this subjectdiscussed this subject with my friends and schoolteachers.
The only thing which really disappointed me was a visit to your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show.
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about the international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions about what you and your students can do during your free time here.
It is possible that only one computer will do all this and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight.
Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the audience.
The idea of going to the science museum is fantastic . I read about the museum, and it is really interesting for the history of science.
Because it's crowded with people.
I wasted 2 hours buying food which you can find in every local shop.
At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood . It tends to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use the Internet .
There are only ten computers in the school .
Only teachers can use them .
The computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get  access to huge informational sources through the Internet, to do shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly.
However , if we rely on it too much, we could become lazy and apathetic and , as a result, will not be able to live without it once it is gone.
The show should start at 19.30 . However, the audience waited for forty fiveforty-five minutes.
This building is situated on the magnificent bank of the Niva River with an excellent view of the Hermitage Museum.
Paul was wondering whether this beast could be aggressive when the creature said these words , "I am glad to meet you, Paul."
I had doubtdoubts when somebody said  that the fashion of the future would be different.
Then in the advertisement it said that the performance began at 19.30.
I felt so miserable that Pat laughed to see me.
Maybe it is right to say  in a flat instead of a building.
It becomes a life and death struggle.
I would also like to know whether someone will be at the airport for me because this will be my first time in the U.S.A.
Regarding your first question, I would like to travel only in July because it is my school holiday so I would not miss any classes.
The accommodation I prefer is a tent.
They always have to be careful about what they say and what they do.
When they were young, they judged another person by his appearance.
The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you will have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even be able switchingto switch on the light by saying simply : " Light".
First of all , you need a lot of time, because the shop is so big.
Almost everyone hates other people gossiping about their private lives.
It's like a joke, but a bit scary.
What kind of people will be invited to your Camp  this summer?
What clothes should I take?
How much money do I need for this trip?
These are the things that I'd like to change; I'd like to do what I really want to do but I don't know if I'm really ready for this!
In my opinion the best time for shopping is weekdays, preferably in the morning.
Now I asked myself if there would be another problem.
This is my vision of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it.
I want to change the school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want.
I have been asked to write a composition regarding the question , ' It is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable.
Thanks to modern technology, I enjoy chatting with my friends in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day.
Again we're so sorry that we are givingare causing you  inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us.
It is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not . They just try to find the best pose.
I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing would be similar, but I have never tried it.
The second one is just because I'm a fan of that sport (really I'm not martine hingis).
And on top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters' strike, so I had to look for another place to have a snack.
In conclusion, I would appreciate it if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected.
At this point I promised myself that I would never do this awful job again.
For example, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I go on the Internet and ask for what I need.
I was very disappointed because I was longing  to see them , as a fan.
This is  a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are shopping and getting clothes from the shelves.
Do you understand me?
All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have devised . They are quite interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich, because some of us may go to the university there next year.
Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historic places (castles  built in the 13th century) or art galleries, as well as the beautiful Bodnant Garden.
I think , next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell her something, eventually everyone knows about it.
During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit the restaurant, which'swhich was a pity, because the restaurant was closed because it was too late.
I used to be the captain of the team of basketballbasketball team in my school, because I was the best player, and I think I can still remember how to play.
But  I think it's not only our fault but  evidence of how much they have integrated themselves into our life.
We can hear many  people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping.
First, the research and design lessons are exciting since we are studying how cars are built.
We  see on the advertisement that discounts are available.
At home we again have rules, but more flexible ones.
Unfortunately, our programme is fixed but I think we could change  part of the programme.
You've just finished your long hours at work, you are tired, you had a row with your boss but you are still going to go shopping.
I can't leave it until that month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of  year.
What should I say to you about home...
I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to Pat, everything started going wrong . Katrin , my friend, and the one I was being bad to, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really didn't know what to do . I was in love with Brett, but I loved my friend too.
I can't  concentrate in a shop, and I can't relax either.
We thought, as usually we do in London theatres, we could get discounts , and it's written on your advertisement that we could.
Secondly, boys are not allowed to have long hair.
Each time  she came back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her figure.
Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I won't be able to write even this letter .
Secondly, in the advertisement it saidsaid that the show was to start at 19:30.
But I did not know it, and I told her my secret: I had fallen in love with Paul , a friend of ours.
What is more, the show is free for all  students.
I hope you are fine.
I was pleased to receive your letter recently.
When our final day arrived, we went shopping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show.
I think many people, especially women, have the same experience.
I don't have any equipment.
The performance started forty fiveforty-five minutes late.
For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting your leg off, the new medical technology could rebuild part of your body.
A log cabin doesn't sound like a camping holiday.
Because most students have never been to London before . Also we can visit some famous places which we want to go to.
People are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar . It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and , if you want , buy something at the shops.
It's good to walk around looking at all the new things in the stores.
I have already read the programme, and I like it, I think that the class will like going  sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going on the river trip to Greenwich . Also, they can visit the Science Museum, and they can go   shopping . On Wednesday 15 March they are going to visit the National Art Gallery, really, I think that is a good programme.
The worst thing was that the actor and actress were not the people who had been written about in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed.
When we arrived she persuaded me to go  backstage because her boyfriend was the band's electrician.
However, we have to consider  our human nature.
I would like to choose surfing as my second activity.
If we want to do something, we can do it at night the same as in the day.
It was not a perfect evening for me and my child at all!
Unfortunately, the next evening, one hour before the beginning of the show, we learnt that the actors had been changed at the last minute.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe become familiar with our culture.
First of all, on the sheet I received, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actors  that. That is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and I don't know what his name is.
In the last one hundred years science and technology has taken a big step , if we look  back.
As you know , last month  I helpedworked at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot.
However , the majority of people point out one  very old building, which you can find at Barkeley Square.
We do not need to light a fire in order to cook as in the old days.
I want you to know what an extraordinary time I had with my friends at the festival.
Then, surfing on the Internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it.
Well, unless there is something wrong with the power supply.
I would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of the accommodation because I have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels .
The things I did were: Preparingpreparing and controllingchecking the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, making sure that all the lights were in perfect working order, that the singers were comfortable and relaxed, etc.
The only people who could live without one  would be extremely weird or  in a very difficult situation!
I was in charge of the stage lights, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage.
With the help of my home computer I can do all kinds of things, with money, with my bank.
Regarding the programme you have organised,  is a great idea everything that you have plannedeverything that you have planned is a great idea, but I would like to suggest  something that the students saw in an advertisement.
If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel like going shopping.
I would like to add that it would definitelydefinitely be a great opportunity because the tickets will be free for students.
I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are shared and how many people are there in one tent.
They were also asked to wear clothes which were in accordance with the occasion.
ThoughHowever, a few of us would like to consider the "London fashion and leisure show".
I am writing to you because yesterday I went to the musical  "Over the Rainbow" and I had a bad evening.
In conclusion, in the future home our living conditions will improve, and the computer will be very important for us, but it won't control us, because we still have the most important thing in a home  . That will be the same as now.
We had a class discussion about shopping, because of it I'm writing to explain about my opinion.
That was a bit boring, but it was part of my job.
Hoping that I have not offended you in any way and that you might take into consideration my suggestions, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation.
I would like to play guitar like him.
My work was for the singers, so I could meet singers and talk with them.
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to give something to someone.
It's hard to be extremely quiet for five hours but I reckon it's a good method of education.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT  IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THE FOLLOWING:
Also I'd like to know about all the accommodation and travel costs that are included in the first prize.
This show was very disappointing for me for many reasons . First of all, I was very surprised by the absence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons for booking a seat.
For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons  and my friends didn't know about that.
Our school is really very disciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviour.
Therefore, even if I agree sometimes the mediasmedia go too far and write really bad things ,
So I am sure you will understand why I am so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incident.
How is your new school and your parents?
 the houseThe house is full of technological tools and instruments .
My friends told me that if we wake up early on Tuesday we can go to the Science Museum at about 8.00 in the morning.
The clothes will be more comfortable but less decorative.
But the thing which I'd never expected happened, which is that Pat betrayed me.
I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate you on the organization.
Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have some free time.
Everything in this room is connected with wine.
I spent one week in London and during my visit I had the good fortune to see "Over the rainbow" at your theatre.
Teaching pupils is not easy, of course.

One of them is in the area of fashion.
It was this last point that got me angry.
Then, I was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so I could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
I have knowledge of navigation, engines, ropes and knots , and  sails as well.
The number of foreign students has recently been increasing.
However, when I got to the theatre, you not only didn't have any discounts but also apologizehad to apologize to us for the delay in starting the musical.

Helen , I would like to ask you how much money we have to take to the Camp?
Because of his behaviour, Pat is now alone and nobody trusts  him.
I think you should invite people from ten countries because there are more and more stars and artists in the world.
It is not really a good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time.
Also the sports activities should be filmed; they express an aggregative and social way of living school life and can be useful to show  the movements of the bodies during the athletics-schoolathletics school eventsschool athletics events.
From the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - and Photography - about which I know just the basic skills.
This book remains one of the best in American literature .
However, there were not any.
Regarding  the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins because I have a lot of experience of putputting up my own tents.
I had enjoyed  my wonderful experiencemy wonderful experience so much.
Moreover, this complaint is not only about the actor, whoever he is, the problem is that the show started too late.
And if I need to bring some money could you suggest  the amount?
The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is a great idea actually, but there were stars and artists from only six countries contrary to your advertisement.
As you know , Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed to be accompanied.

Every day scientists and technologisttechnologists discover and produce more and more new things and that is good . It has to be like that, we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now.
I really think that living in the future will be like living on the moon  - very exciting.
 I am thankful to modern technology!
Fashion is a part of our lives, even for those who will never recogniseadmit it.
So all you need to improve things are  larger concert halls.
As well as that, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowadays, however , it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport and everything you have to do.
Last but not least, I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year.
Hunting on the high street, or the shopping malls  for the desired bargain - because we can't afford to buy anything otherwise - often becomes a desperate attempt to attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consumerist society.
After the concert I had to clean the area and it took a long time because people had beenhad behaved like pigs.
I was all the more angry as the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , as  was written in your ad!
I think it is  bombastic.
Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must get 5000$ and take it out onto the street.

Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into  every shop.
I could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous, but it was not even quite interesting.

One event that should not be missed   is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other.

As we had already missed the first  we went to the theatre restaurant , which is famous for its good food, however , it was closed.
I am writing to give you the further information about myself.

These days, the castle is being rebuilt, so there is a lot of construction machinery around it.
We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go there.
It was too few for this festival.
So in fact people's homes will become more convenient and more comfortable.
First of all, it is said that the stars are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor was not Danny Brook.
Pat obviously couldn't keep silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandal-mongering press, not knowing that Paul had made up the whole story!
On the other hand I have never taken a course in climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby.
Computers have changed people's lives . Many of them can work from home, they don't need to go to their offices.
I don't think there is anything I'd like to change!
It was such a disappointing evening out with my friend during our  week's holiday in London.

In my opinion shopping is just something to cover our basic needs.
The band "Three Kings" presented a new style of music.
Regarding accommodation, I think tents would be great.
The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed , so at 20.15 the curtain of the stage was raised.
As you said, all accommodation and travel costs are paid , but I am sure I still need to take some money with me.
I trusted him and told him  the truth.
So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they knew her feelings for Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything ever.
My disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets, but as we wanted to see Danny Brook's performance, we decided to buy them anyway.
Our homes should just protect us from dangers from outside.
One day, Pat and I were going home, when she asked me  if I would give a party before I go.
I think that some concert halls are too small, so you should be sure about   in advance.
Thank you for organising a good programme, we especially like sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich in London for three days.
First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your concern about your customers.
I expect you will be even better organised next year.
It was a shame.
I do not have words to express how happy I am .
I would like to thank you and Camp California for this opportunity.
Many people don't like Maths because they think that it's a boring subject.
In my opinion these are the most interesting things in our school.
Worst of all, at the end of the Musical, I went to  your Theatre Restaurant, in order  havingto have  dinner, because I had left home without eating and so I was hungry at that time.
Please answer my letter as soon as  possible.
But it started at 20:15!

During it, everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference.
He wanted everything that his eyes saw.
All this modern technology increases the level of waste products that cannot be easily destroyed.
In the last fifty years  human technologies have grown  exponentially.
Then how has it changed our daily life?
In my opinion, the clothes will be more colourful, fun and comfortable.
I know how to develop films and print photographs.
Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assistants  try to sell any product to the "victim" enteringcoming through the door.
I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.

I can come only in July because I have to work the other months of summer.
Secondly, the show started one hour late and I hate waiting in a queue longer than is necessary.
In addition I think that opinions about the schoolsome personal opinions about the school should be reported by asking students and teachers.
We can show our figure in winter as well.
They will show the latest fashion, leisure and sportswear and something for the women: make-up and hairstyle trends.
On top of everything, you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show.

First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a lower price than £20 for my six-year-old daughter.
I am recommending you check your possible time to work - weekdays or weekend?
I wasn't too worried because if someone was going to see my parents, I would tell them before not to talk about the exams.
With the help of some modern technology our daily lives would not be so difficult.
There isn't any kind of punishment for people who do these things.
Really, what a mess with the administration.
First of all, I would prefer travelling in July, because I will be on vacation and I'm not allowed to travel during term.
English is the most popular language in the world . What's more, more and more people are starting to learn English.
The first point I would like to make is that the private life of a celebrity is open to the public.
At the Camp I want to stay in a log cabin.
I would be glad if you considered my suggestions.
It was a very good experience for me .
It is because of the increasing size of the population and the shortage of  oxygen gas in the atmosphere.
The museum looks very old , like some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside.
Anyway, I expected to have a perfect evening out , however , I just had a terrible time, everything went wrong.
IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT HOBBIES AND JOBS.
I would like to travel in July because my holidays are only in that month and the weather in California is better then.
Therefore, shopping can be enjoyable but that is not always the case.
Our school, as  is well known, is a technical school and consequently its daily life consists of different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories.
So we can read realistic stories or fantastic ones . It depends on what we prefer.
I've been busy preparing for English exams.
It will be a really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London.
Except in some very extraordinary cases, no.
Finally, you would like to know about some activities for three hours of free time.
In our school we have a system of "double lessons".
Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change to the programme: the star!
I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement , which stated that it would be my 'perfect evening out', when it was quite the opposite.
I had a lot of fun  there.
I'm pleasantpleased to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
It is more fun and friendliermore sociable.
It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousands of kilometres away from me.

I would like to thank you and give some of the information you asked about me.
How can you dare putpublish an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know it is closed?
To answer another of your questions, I am more likely to want to stay in a log cabin , considering that I will be two weeks in the camp.
Secondly, the show started after a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed.
After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed because someone has fixed something there.
I would prefer to stay in tents as  accommodation because it sounds thrilling and even ecstatic to me , and also I have never tried this kind of accommodation before.
Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant event during my holiday in London.

I would like a log cabin because I think you should provide me with good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity or entertainment.

I go look round the shops.
The queues are not the only problem . If you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of  carrier bag carrier bags during  your journey and you won't alwaysalways be lucky enough to find a seat sit.
You have also written in your advertisement that it would start at half past seven but it started at 20:15!
The best thing was of course meeting Tina.

On top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructuredrepaired, so I couldn't have my dinner either!

About the hotel , it is clean, and hasprovides a good service . The rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting  good Valuevalue.
The place is the college garden.
Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip would be reduced.
The second answer is that  shopping makes everyone happy.
I hope next year there will be more play and films and that the ticket will be reasonably priced like this year so that people not really interested in arts could come and enjoy the festival.
Regarding the accommodation, if  possible I would like to stay in a tent because I think it is a relaxing place  to stay.

We all know that you have organised everything.
She was always being pursued by the media.
Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the full  price.

We all are interested in fashion and hairstyles and it is a great opportunity for us because students do not have to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour.
It is really easy to get to the conference from the hotel.
From the past until now, we have been wearing several different types of fashionable clothing, but why?
Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadget in old clothes, like a dress from the Middle Ages.
Furthermore, I found the time went quickly and they offered me a new project for the summer.
I have found it very expensive to buy them but there are a number of advantages.
I would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world, for instance , the Far East, Indonesia etc.
Also I bought a £20 ticket because  the advertisement for the show said that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets.
Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there were not any discounts for tickets, while you wrote the contrary.
Regarding the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in a log cabin, because family it is more comfortableit is more comfortable for me and my family.

If I cannot get a satisfactory reply within a month I shall go to the consumer protection organisation to sue you.
I have never used one and I think it would be more exciting than tents.
Thank you very much for your time.
I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the annual sports tournament or welcoming evening for new students.
I usually sing in my spare time and my friends love it when I sing and regarding swimming I was champion last year in my city.
Jogging or  some sports?
Regarding  what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you take the students to our History Museum.

Thank you very much for your attention on my behalf
How will the home of the future be?
These days, there are so many people who like shopping that it is one of the important parts of our life.
My parents are afraid of it because I got my licence onlyonly got my licence in September.
I must say that it wasn't our perfect evening out!
I would like to sum up by saying that every person, whether famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed.
About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a tent because it will be a new experience for me.
You can do anything you like as long as you have good grades.
Many people enjoy going shopping , meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience.
WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS  AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED IN THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M.
Secondly , the  service often makes us angry.
Most of the people  like to go to the centre of the City , that's Meong-Dong where underground arcadethe underground arcade is and several businesses have their headquarterheadquarters there.
I'm so happy about the experience I had last month.
I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professionally.
The best time would be from 17th July till 30th July.
I hadn't ever seen so much money.
(I like him very much and, frankly, I came to the theatre just to see him)
However, drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me.
I would  appreciate it if I could stay in a tent at the Camp .
It is a great opportunity to see the show because we are keen on fashions and clothes.
So I am fully entitled to ask for a refund for my evening out.
It gets enormously unbearable on hot summer days, when the temperature increases.
By the way, I would like to travel in July, because I just have free time in July.
Every family now has a TV, to travel  long distances we use not just the car but also the train and aeroplane.
The show started much later,  45 minutes later than it should have so I was late for the bus.
About the information requested from me , I have to say that I can travel only in July because of my job; I am busy until the end of June.
The only thing is , we need to know what kind of thing  we want to buy and where can wewe can buy cheaper and better quality stuff.
PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY A FEW DAYS, AFTER WHICH THE SECRET CAME FROM  DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID.
I realised I had to run away, but I still had her letter.
 students it is freeIt is free for students.
As for the colours, I think  metallic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular.
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unknown actor who starred instead of him.
What more do you want?
According to your programme we have some free time on Wednesday, March 15.
In schools we aren't allowed to speak in class.
People now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home.
One of the most beautiful things in the world is  true and loyal friendship.
In particular, the computer has changed my daily life dramatically.
Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view over the city.
It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultural variety of the whole world.
After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but when I arrived at the restaurant it had been closed.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in a tent.
In addition, although you advertised that discount tickets were available, they do not sell them any more according to your staff.
Also this person was not really good at acting.
Those are only my opinions . You don't need to agree with them, but one day you might find out that what I have said is not totally wrong.
We will not wear black clothes as we  used to .
I will come to your office this week.
In addition to all this, there was no discount on the price of the tickets  for students either, contrary to what I was told on the phone when I asked for more information.
After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun and we will eat in Mc'Donalds.
But it was completely different  to what I had expected.
On the other hand, everything at the shopping centre is more expensive, because the people that shop there usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need  is already at this place.
Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in a dangerous and poor way and I don't know how, but he was able to persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, on my 25th birthday.
Do I need to take very many clothes?
It'sIt was a good idea to send them to me, because I have to confess that I have lost my camera and also the films.
I'd like to explain too that I didn't see  you give any discounts to anyone.
Nowadays, quite a few famous people suffer in their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters.
On Wednesday after we have visited the National Art Gallery, we can have a chat about our next holiday during the free time in the afternoon.
I don't think I'll have the chance  to do it again in the future.
I am writing to you concerning the three days which we are going to spend in London.
Of course, she knew Nick didn't like her to tell other people  about his private life.
This report shows which lessons and activities are best to film in order to make a short video about daily life at our school.
If  so, please let me know as soon as possible.
Secondly there was a delay which got me into trouble .
The first one is tennis and the second one is sailing.
When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of an electric shock to his finger, I felt I was short of breath.
Or you decide not to spend the money  shopping today, staying outside of the shop.
I think we will know a writer's life or how he is writing about it ?
So what's the point of saying 'visit our restaurant after the show'?
Please let me know what the climate is like at the camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes.
I learn a lot about their culture by speaking to them on the Internet.
Could you imagine  no telephone ringing in the office?
It is simple to find your way from this hotel to the conference.
My name is Alida Fanetti, and I'm writing to you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently.
Secondly, I couldn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes late.
It's good that he is far away...
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style . We might also get a chance to meet new people and interact with them.
So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big holiday, I would rather stay at home and watch television.
I would prefer a tent to sleep in at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents and to compare it to sleeping in a house.
It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what clothes will be like 100 years from now.
We would have fun, meet the locals and practise our English at the same time.
Second, I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening.
I didn't see any discounts available ; I thought my son would paidhave paid less than I.
And I didn't even get paid.
The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but on this evening it started at 20.15.
I hope this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together.
At the end of conferenceend of the conference there is a party, where we can eat something, dance and speak to each other about the conference.
Firstly, I am a student . I don't have a job, so, I have to ask for money from my parents.
I would prefer to go to the Camp in July.
I am a student in the English class.
So I choose singing and swimming as my activities.
Well as I said , if you're poor, the government will still give you a flat but a very ugly one, probably with rats in it.
I am happy to visit the United States with your organisation.
When I was in high school, I joined  the swimming club.
I'm quite sure that people  all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful , will create and invent all kinds of clothes for anybody .
You asked me which hotel the group had been booked into.
I am sending you some pictures, the best ones only because there were some quite embarrassing ones.
Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes we are supposed to wear there, and about the money we are supposed to bring to pay for food and things like that.
when she turned around  talking and whispering started.
She has an open mind.
I've had unpleasant experiences on my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent.
After the show I needed to drink something in the theatre restaurant as the advertisement   conceived, but it was closed.
I HAVE SENT YOU SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME WITH THE BAND.
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July, due to  problems beyond my control.
Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening, and I think you should know that tickets were sold without any discounts.
Unfortunately for me Pat at the time was going to the toilet and saw me.
This was one of the best and most exciting days of my life.
One of my friends suggested that we should have  a part-time job , which was that.
I am writing to inform you that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place at  university and it will start in August.
Another thing that regardsoccurs to me, is that I enjoy myself more when I know I have to go shopping for myself than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!
In comparison to my grandparents who have real problems accepting these changes in modern technology.
Thank you very much for organising the programme of our three-day visit to London.
I hope I have given to you all the information you need and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
I'd like to do climbing and sailing.
You can inform all the students that they can take some traditional food to the party.
About activities, I enjoy painting most, because I have been a plastic artist since I was nine and I've won lots of prizes with my art.
About tennis, I just started to play last year and I need to improve my technique a lot.
As you know, I am a big fan of "The Max".
According to the advertisement, discounts should have been available  but, in fact, I was refused a discount.
I would prefer to travel only in July because it's when my vacations start.
I come from a very strict family.
You can find any information from it that you want.
Because of that, people's needs have increased a lot nowadays.
At the very moment when he saw me, his eyes began to shine and I could feel that he had recovered some hope.
I'm writing to you to make a complaint about your advertisement, which I consider  a lying advertisement.
You must be organised, clean and respect the rights of other people.
Firstly, I am very happy to win this first prize and as expected I'm following your instructions.
Please let me know what clothes  I need  and how much money in cash and  travellers cheques should I take with me.
Especially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them.
This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998, but it wasn't 13th even it look like it, but it was my 25th birthday.
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW" WHICH WAS PERFORMED LAST WEEK.
Secondly, I would  appreciate it if I could stay in log cabins at Camp.
In addition to this, I listened to bad singers and noticed a considerable lack of variety in the dancing.
I note that all accommodation and travel costs are paid , but does it include my expenses in California?
Secondly I would prefer to stay in a tent as it will be natural life while I am at the Camp.
I would be very grateful to receive answers to my questions.
I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days  of our stay in London  and would like to thank you.
Finally, could you let me know what the weather is like in July in the States?
And I understand that you need help, so  I will help you as far as I can.
Thank you very much for your letter .
We all decided  to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth.
I would like to join the camp in July because I can get a holiday from my company from 1th July to 28th July.
To help her husband she works out a plan: she is willing to be a witness for the prosecution and states that her husband was not with her at the time the crime was committed.
Surfing was a new sport to me which I took up recently.
Have you ever spent more money than you should during a visit to the shopping center?
Because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the Internet  to study or do research, because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and  all wish to attend.
If you asked the young people what they spend their money on most, most of them would answer 'clothes'.
So it was not "my perfect evening out" and because of my disappointment I am writing to ask you for some money back.
I have never felt such  satisfaction.
Yesterday I went to the  play called "Over the Rainbow" , for which I saw the advertisement in today's Guardian.
When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and said that he was Marine's father and he wantwanted to take her ,
I see a lot of pretty things but I have to abandon the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me.
And finally, I would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought I would go to 'Theatre restaurant'.
In the advertisement it also said  you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason.
Because of  modern technology, the safety level of my car is very high.
So you can see that it was not a so perfect an evening for me as I expectedhad expected.
One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer country during the winter.
I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time there very much.
It is wonderful how  technology makes things so easy.
At surfing I am not good at all.
In my eyes they are wasting their lives, they are hopeless.
Sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality.
I was enthusiastic about this special event.
I would also like to know how much money I will get from you for these two weeks because I would like to spend some money on clothes.
There are many historic buildings .
When I was younger , I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching in libraries, looking for old books.
Some families have rules that you have to put spoons and dishes everyday.
I was impressed when I heard that she liked doing puzzles alone.
Maria and Ivan were poor again.
And I would love to learn surfing and painting.
Finally, we had a totally miserable night at your show.
I've been dreaming of travelling to the U.S.A for so many years.
Then , suddenly, Pat looked confused and she said in a small voice, ' Didn't they break up a long time ago?
It was an old woman asking who Maria was.
She spent the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock.
According to the response these are the most important activities pupils would like to film (80 per cent of those questioned wanted these things filmed)
I liked seeing their way of life.
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and labs should be filmed for a short video.
I would be very pleased if I could practisedo tennis and surfing.
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about which lessons and activities should be filmed.
I had a really good time with this experience because I could meet my favourite singer.
We are young and we are all interested in fashion.
As regards the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to do painting and photography.
We were told that  discounts were available but they were not.
My job  behind the stage was helping with make-up, hair and clothes styling.
I think of an internet. "
I was in her room  helping her.
And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we came to the conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult.
Perhaps, armour will become a craze again.
Therefore, our life has been influenced and changed by the development of technology.
Last summer I went to the Amazon on an expedition with 10 other people :  a guide, a doctor, a scientist &amp; all the rest of us like me were just curious.
Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California in July.
Also I would suggest filming  lunch in the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noise inside the restaurant because of the babbling.
The more saw her I I saw her, the more determined I became.
I mean, all those flashing lights, with their changing colours, I believe they helped a lot.
I think that it was very stupid, but it is the most difficult thing that  man can do.
You should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comparecompared to travelling by public transport.
To make it worse, neither discounts nor restaurants were available  that night although they were said to be available.
For the first few days, Pat was with us all the time.
People are inventing new kinds of clothes and people are buying and wearing different clothes.
We could show the team spirit of our school through sports activities like soccer, basketball or handball.
I am writing about the letter that I recently received from you, which is about a competition in which I have won the first prize.
I hope you read this and write to me to let me know something about my money
I can play tennis better you I can swim, because since I was a child I've been playing it.
To sum up, although I think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
When I was a kid I used to ask my mum to buy me a tent for my bedroom so I would be able to sleep in there instead of my bed.
As you can see, technology is about saving  time, so we may have more time to do what we like.
It has allowed me to worry about other things in my life.
- Later on we'll  sing the song  "Old McDonald had a farm".
Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with the hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in.
When the first car appeared, it was already a great success.
Anyway, to participate in two-weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information.
When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friends and to my family than before.
When you ask some people to express their opinions about shopping they might tell you they don't like shopping but I don't suppose it is true.
Yes, there is a bus that takes you to the concert and brings you back.
I have just attended classes in them.
First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, which disappointed me very much.
Lastly, I think that all these changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly.
On the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but another handon the other hand they discovered many illnesses hadn't heardwhich we hadn't heard about before.
Secondly, although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre, we could not be given any discounts only because we had booked at a travel agency.
So I paid for the ticket.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO READ BOOKS, WRITE, LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND, NOWADAYS, YOU CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS USING A COMPUTER.
I expected to see a variety of nationalities.
It is built on the top of the hill and around it there is only a huge field.
Your only task consists in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner , for instance;
It is a very good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class will enjoy.
I like taking photographs, in my  room.
Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is enough money, it would be better to have the opportunity to watch more movies.
You had better invite more nationalities'nationalities .
I think this festival is a great idea because it's an opportunity to see and to appreciate  art, but  I also think there are some things that could be changed.
CellularA cellular phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car has broken down on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth.
It will be the most exciting activity on this trip.
In my opinion, small shops and the outsidestreetstreet markets should be supported . On the other hand , the big supermarkets should think more about the recycling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.
I hope to hear from you soon
Nowadays our shopping habits seem to have changed.
Danny Brook didn't act in the performance, there was another , unknown , actor.
With the help of the "Internet" it is possible to get a lot of objective and useful information you are interested in.
Obviously, I had to try another aisle.
It was at lunchtime.
I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
To conclude we could film our teachers' lives too.
It could be  that people will wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves.
How much money should I bring with me for the two-week stay?
SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER .
Besides this, I am very good at playing basketball.
I suppose that you understand my situation, because you did not tell the truth.
We have been talking for hours in our class about the media's treatment of famous people.
I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins  because I have been  camping once and I stayed in tents.
Some weeks later when Pat was walking to school she met Sally, who had just come out of Paul's house.
Finally, I'd like to mention the reasonably-priced weekend ticket.
I would be really happy if I could choose singing and photography from  activities you have listed.
In addition to this, the time , 19.30 , wasn't correct.
Because of the crowds.
The conference is situatedtaking place in the building opposite the bus stop.
I want to play tennis and to go swimming.
Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes in my seat , so it made me upset.
When the show started I was on the stage close to two famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie.
So, in my opinion, new technology has changed, is changing and will change my daily life ;
I hope that afterwards my life will be better.
This is a precise letter that I write to you now.
First of all, dishwashers are very efficientconvenient for me because I work full-time and look after my children.
I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose to see Over The Rainbow, but I didn't even see him on the stage.
Almost all the people had a Television which provided events around our country very quickly.
I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow , the musical show , which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night.
I am delighted to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all be paid for in advance.
However , most famous people, for example football players and film stars, have not got a private life.
No one will walk on roads.
I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with  others.
if I have to take any special equipment for the activities that I've chosen
A simple example, we can , at the same time , wash our clothes in a washing machine, record a TV programme and talk to someone on the other side of the world.
They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet-proof and other dangerous-liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves .
These clothes have to be made of something light, comfortable to wear and protective.
And another thing, when the  show was over, I was really hungry.
That is why I can't swim yet.
If you don't mind, we can go  shopping in this free time.
I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have chosen two from your list: basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been part of a strong team for three years.
I am writing to give you the information that you asked me for.
Also as electronicelectronicsnew electronics are produced, our home of the future will be more convenient.
For me modern technology is things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, hi-fi sound systems, television or even cars.
It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around by just making a click with your mouse and you are there.
As an example let's have a look and we will see  this nation and how it has developed.
On the other hand if you can walk around without any time problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable.
These days people are shopping more often than they used to.
Now I will tell you in brief exactly what happened to me.
By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them  from only six countries.
Why media areare the media so interested in famous people?
They described the future world where people would travel to the moon.
I am writing this letter to you to point out the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and what happened in real life.
When I was twenty years old, I had to go into the Army.
Why film the school?
I think that the International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful.
I like to sing a song when I am alone.
I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have a one-month break in July, so please book my log cabin for July.
I appreciate all  this.
In the afternoon we go shopping ; that's  how you have organised  your programme.
In 100 years most  clothes will be made from synthetic material.
But the question is: why is shopping not always enjoyable?
Finally, we would like to ask you to think about our suggestion .
The show would be fantastic .
We would learn about the latest fashions,  Leisure and sports wear, and also learn  how to apply make up.
take  how much moneyHow much money will I need to take?
First of all, when I paid for my ticket I noticed that nobody could obtain the discount you'd written about.
But also I'm aware  that  time flies for me.
The Internet is certainly the most obvious of all these innovations.
Contrary to your advertisement I did not have a "perfect evening out" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ I paid for my ticket.
Secondly, I would like to sleep in log cabins while I am staying at the camp.
Also, it was certain for me to be able to buy a discount ticket because I am a student.
The report is based on the opinions of more than 300 pupils.
' You told me that you were going to put it in your wallet.'
First of all, I believe that if someone has time to go to the shops they should.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.
It will be a pleasure for me to give you the information that you need.
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressful situations.
If someone doesn't know much about the event which he is attending, even if he wears neatsmartsmart clothes, he doesn't look like a gentleman.
The people in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to.
I think also housewives will receive more help with a robot in the home.
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, I strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests.
BESIDES , THAT WOULD KEEP US AWAY FROM DRUGS, DON'T YOU THINK ?
I was regretting  having risked staying in the park alone.
These inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
In my opinion, the main advantage is the development of medical technology.
It seems that going shopping is a reason for living.
I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you like, in which I also play the guitar.
It was very nice to hear from you.
Do I need a lot of money etc. for the different excursions
' That's me!'
It was very necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer.
I am rather good at it.
And we knew that from that day on  that if he knew anything about our secret we would live in danger of being caught.
The microphones all had to be checked.
It has an interesting past.
And due to these bizarre experiences I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink.
What do you think about going to  the Arts Museum?
Moreover, many sports activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on.
I visitedI saw it yesterday evening in your 'Circle Theatre'.
The International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea.
It helps me with preparing my homework.
Also, it was said there would be discounts on the tickets but I had nothing like this.
Lots of people came to this area, and I also learnt how to arrange something.
So, you can contact other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond with country peoplepeople in other countries in real time by using the Internet.
Furthermore, I should choose between two activities and say how good I am at each one.
I always use many electric appliances; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juicer, fridge.
Before using a mobile-phone, if someone wanted to talk to me immediately, they couldn't find  where I was.
We really like the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will take place on Tuesday and we are very interested in going.
I hope we will meet next year at the festival.
After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to seeing it.
This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish for something good.
Fourth, the restaurant was closed for renovation and you shouldn't have proposed we go.
In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there is always some fun you can have.
When we got inside  it, we saw a lot of fans wearing T-shirts, caps and shouting, "Almendegos, Almendegos..." (that is the name of the band).
Do you remember when I told you that my dream was to help Mano's group?
The Internet on our body".
If you don't do that, I will tell the public that you are wrong in your advertisement.
(I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday) , when I found a beautiful store .
I stopped in front of it and started looking at the window display (outside), then I thought it was interesting and went in.
My life has been changed by technological improvementsadvances.
Then the show actually started at 20:15 and not at 19:30!
A short video, shown to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school.
As  my second activity, I would like to choose photography, because my education  included photography . I love taking  photographs of nature.
I am writing to complain about your show.
Of all the recent technological advances, the one that has had the greatest impact on my life is the Internet.
Last month there was a robbery in a shopping centre next to my house . Somebody stole a lady's purse with all her identification, credit cards and cash, even  her plane ticket.
I enjoyed the dance shows, and the jazz and rock concerts.
But how could I , it was closed!
How are you?
For instance, reading, looking for some information or using the computer.
We're thinking that we can go to these places the  following day.
I stood at the entrance and there I had to check the tickets.
So, I have decided to choose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them.
One of the reasons why  I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't appear!
When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant .
I could not get in because it was closed as the restaurant's chef was not there.
And, because of these problems, I'd like to have my money back.
The fact is it was quite different from the one I had expected to see.
I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won, in which you requested some additional information.
The tickets were a little expensive but I was with another TEN people, so when we read "Discounts Available" we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for groups of  people.
I am very pleased I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am looking forward to my holiday , which begins on the first of July lasting until twenty-first July , so it is possible  travelto travel at this time.
That took a long time.
The trial was long and received  wide coverage from the media.
After all the things that I have mentioned it is clear  that shopping is not enjoyable.
Finally, the restaurant which belongs to the theatre was closed.
And look at us now.
A lot of famous people have been to this library !
It is worth to spendspending time and money on that.
We should go to the science museum because we are all doing science in school.
I'm looking forward to seeing you next summer after my exams.
In this area you can also find other different buildings, which would be attractiveto you.
. It was written in the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to star with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who starred.
In the advertisement the time when the show should start was 19.30 but it started at 20:15.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
I looked at my watch: 20:45.
I have just received your letter saying that I have won the competition . I must say I was really surprised and happy to be given the opportunity to join the Camp for two weeks.
I love to take photos but I don't have any technique.
I would like to know if I should take any winter clothes, and I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money is necessary for the trip.
The building of the Academy of Art in St Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting because of its historic and educational aspects.
If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comforts (born just in the "industrial age") everything had to be done by hand or by animal labour: I think at that time life was really much harder than now!
First of all the hotel Richard Brown lookedhas looked at is the Palace Hotel.
In my opinion, modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions.
I especially liked that time.
We are sure this is suitable for all of us.
Finally , on your last day , I suggest you do a sightseeing tour in our town.
asked Philip , showing the keys to the car.
In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying our luggage and shopping bags.
The whole night, I felt backache and shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well.
After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is overpriced.
SINCE I HAVE A CHOICE OF ACCOMMODATION, I'LL DEFINITELY GO FOR THE LOG CABIN, BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR THE HEAT INSIDE A TENT.
An actor was changed and the public were not informed.
Everybody says I have an excellent voice . I like to sing when I am painting too . It's so relaxing.
This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all interested in clothes, sports and fashion.
You won't dance but the earnings are guaranteed!
I am always available on my mobile phone, which is also boring sometimes!
I could not get it.
Please do not hesitate to contact me on (0297) 8245123 in case you should need me.
We suppose that during our free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping.
You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not performing and I was more bewildered that no one made an apology for it!
In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you had mentioned in the advertisement performing, so we were disappointed.
And of course this stops me every time from living a sociable lifefrom living a sociable life every time.
In addition we will have the opportunity to see the newest make-up and hairstyles.
To sum up, everything you do in small quantities is good and fun, but don't increase the amount you do if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.
The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing  homework and in the evening learning with my Computer.
She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understanding.
We are all excited about the programme you've prepared for us, especially about  visiting the National Art gallery.
Other students work as house or office managers, promotion ofsell different goods or even work as  bouncers.
In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private lives of  famous people.
And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard work we all were a little proud to be here.
Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of the holiday.
Moreover,  pocket money we will spendhow much money do you think we will spend on this trip ?
My composition is going to focus on two main ideas: how  modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life.
In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which had been closed for repairs  one month ago.
I would like to know about the clothes  which are suitable for activities.
So, people won't have to clean their houses because there will be a machine for all the work.
I would  prefer to stay in a tent than stay in the log cabin because a tent is more enjoyable.
The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of a lot of money and a lot of treasure.
The bad side is we can use technology for war - missiles, weapons, etc....
Moreover my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city without a cellular phone because it is too far and she gets worried.
Yesterday was Valentine's day here in Portugal .
particularlyIn particular I had to spend it alone... again.
I entered  this competition because I have always wanted to do this kind of thing.
For example , if you look back to the forties and compare  homes then with nowadays , you can see that they have become more modern, especially the equipment in the kitchen and in the living room.
It seems to be incredible, but it's common habitsnormal for us.
we don't think that   less than a hundred years ago, none of that existed.
I have just worked as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I always see on TV.
After that all the singers arrived and I was in charge of greeting them and giving them something to drink.
After the conference some food and drink will be available in the sport centersports centersports centre , which is well equipped for discodiscos.
So the loss was bigger than the profit.
We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person.
In particular, Mike , who is a member of Metal Potato told me I have got a talent for playing the electric guitar.
Cooking has become faster with the help of the microwave.
When I first read the advertisement, I thought that it would be fun.
I wonder if you could explain to me why.
One example in my life is home banking.
On Sunday all the English press were waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all a hoax, they got so angry that they wrote in every newspaper that Pat had made up everything!

That was not true!

And it also saves my time which would be used up  doing housework such as laundry, cleaning rooms and ironing.
First, I would like to talk about your section "Stars and Artists".
The festival was excellent in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.
I was so disappointed about that.

I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AT 19.30 AND I WAITED FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES!!

I am writing to you in order to get further information about my trip to Camp California and to make some things a bit clearer for you.
I hope that you can provide a better service next time, and this time you need to give back the money we paid.

Before I go out , I make a plan.
I would appreciate it if you could inform me if I have to bring any money for extra costs or even any special kind of clothes for those activities.

Though the Internet has a lot of positive aspects , I think you should be careful with it and not be dependent on it.

I would like to make some appointmentscomments about the event that I went to.
Dear Mrs Smith,.
Hello Maria.
Maybe it would be better to put more of them in the programme because young people like them so much.
I also have a sailing licence but I have not done it for a long time.
In the advertisement  that I received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept waiting for it to start for half an hour.
The reason for this is  global warming, which is the solution for the problem and another reason why this idea is possible.
When we arrived, there were a lot of people, the place was beautiful, all seemed perfect.
I wondered what kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take.
I've always wanted to go to the U.S.A.
This is the most arguingarguablecontentious point.
I saw the pink coloured snow there.
I'm not the kind of person who can easily fall asleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent.
After all this , I wanted to make my evening pleasant but to my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because of some sanitary problems.
The biggest difference the absence of TV made in my life was that I actually started living.

When we are   shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for  shopping is too crowded and it makes us more tired.
I was so excited that I couldn't believe it.
The hotel is near the station and is called "Grand Placad".
Besides the boredom of having to wait for forty-five minutes, we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show, since it was already closed by the time the show finished.

My prize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at their concert.
It will be a fantastic experience for me.
I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I like musicals and also I like Danny Brook.
I would like to ask about  money.
First of all, it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in the real show, it wasn't.
Can I change some money at the camp or near it?
Secondly the start of the show was far from punctual.
So I now need a "perfect - refund -" in replacement for your "perfect evening out".
Then, I consider it a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress.
I think not.
Because it was just a waste of money going to your show.
The English class is going to make a short video about the school's daily life.
I usually don't buy a lot of them but I must admit that some of them are useful.
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect that.

I have never tried this sport, so I can't play golf at all.
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear on show.
Most of the modern jobs involve computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and the Internet, the kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk.

In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't have the chance to do this and the family where we were staying   kindly boiled the water for us.
And the best way to get from there to the conference is  by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.

Modern life  has been full of science and technologiestechnology.
I was grateful to hear  I have won first prize in the competition.
I have never worked without a computer, but if we hadn't any , we would find it normal.
Secondly, as you know , we'll have a party after the conference, which will take place at our student council hall with some meals.
I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem, you can contact  me anytime.
About the activities listed in your letter, I choose basketball and singing.
So I would like to suggest you change  part of the programme so we can visit this show.
Secondly, the 19:30 show only started at 20:15; thirdly, your advertisement said: "Discounts available"; but it wasn't the case.

To sum up, according to the survey, it's obvious that more than half of the students want the acting lesson to be filmed.
You can do  shopping on the Internet and it might be the fastest way to gather any information you would like to find.
But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you knew it would be closed.
From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular.
But when we think about it seriously , shopping is not enjoyable , for example , if you forget something that you need for a salad.
Even though we want to make things as comfortable as possible for our students.
It was about 21:00, I thought it was a bit later but it wasn't my fault anyway.
Firstly, there was a different actor/actress whose name I have never heard before.
So they both found the person they dreamed of.
One of the most positive aspects of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket.
According to the title of the advertisement, which was a great idea, there would be stars and artists from around the world  but they were only from six countries.
However, those days were unforgettable for me.
During my stay I read an advertisement for a musical show being put on at The Circle Theatre.
As you may have heard, our city is well known for the musicals.

The area for parking, space for children to play or bus station near the mall are not really appropriateadequate.
Since the end of the 40's , which is the period when  technology started to advance, nobody can say that nothing has changed.
.. The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar  - you know how much I love playing guitar  - and all these video cameras were just filming us.
I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example ,  24 hours  a day, and all the things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who are your friendsyour friends are, where you go shopping, who you love  and who you sleep with.
To sum up, modern technology will bring lots of changes and our daily lives will be more convenient.
You can see the sign for the hotel.
When the sons were old they began to talk about their life , beginning with this story , which happened a long time ago
If you have any more questions, write back to me.
I was pleased to be seeing Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the stage!
All the shops are full of people, and people treat the articlesitems like rubbish .
The museum is located in Ouchy, opposite the "Delamuraz Hotel".
Every season we can see the arrival of new styles, fabrics and proportions.
There are a lot of shopping styles in the world .
I am sure everybody preferslikes one of them.
If you do that, there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them.
As regards the activities, I would enjoy tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have learnt some techniques  that I would like to put into practice.
But when I was fifteen my favourite book was " The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie".
Also, in the advertisement you mentioned discounts which were not provided.
First of all I would like to say that I think it is important in this video to concentrate on a few  interesting parts of our daily life at school
Moreover, there weren't any discounts available (I'm a student but I paid for a full-price ticket).
In conclusion I think that there must be more comprehensionunderstanding and respect between famous people and the media.
Because I stayhave never stayed in a tent before.
It would be better if you had some more large halls  like your "Arena" hall.
I have great experience of sailing.
you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tells you "I'm sorry, this one is sold out"!
Enclosing the information you asked for, there are some points  I want to point out.
I would not like to take legal action, as it would not be convenient for either of us, but I will if I consider it necessary.
Modern technology has been changing  human life since the first man was born.
Firstly, I can only travel in July because I have no time except in July as I am a postgraduate student.
When we arrived at the restaurant we  realised that it was closed because the cook was ill.
After this last point of troubles we went home with only bad memories of this evening.
Say hello to your parents!
Whereas, my mother was very keen on shopping for everything.
I hope  I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply to my ones.
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer  the students the best way to spend their time without wasting time with silly places or events.
If you would like to get more information, you will ask me every time.
But I hope you will wear a formal suit and dress.
Her father had met another woman who was not as pretty as Maria's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary.
EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS BRAVERY AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS.
It was supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour.
On the one hand, I own a camera that I often use during my leisure time.
New materials will be invented and new styles will be created either by designers or people themselves , which leadwill lead to changes in fashion , but in addition  materials will probably still be used such as denim, which was invented ages ago in America.
Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor starred in the actual show and his performance was absolutely horrible, and disappointing.
she said to herself . "I am just a servant in this castle .
love him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle."
Yours sincerely,
That was a disappointment for my whole family .
I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loved.
She began to share that secret with everybody , including the teachers.
I am writing to provide the information that you need from me.
I am so amazed about winning the competition.
I am very pleased to help to organize this Conference in our College, which will be held at the Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days.
They have used animal and fish skins, some plants and herbal things rather than chemicals.
Further I would prefer to stay in a tent at the camp, because I am already used to that, because I often spend my holidays in tents.
I SPEND MOST OF MY DAY IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE MACHINES, STUDYING, RESEARCHING, PLAYING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
I am writing to you because I received your letter concerning the prize of two weeks in California that I have won.
For all these reasons, I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon!
To finish this letter  , I would like to give you a good idea for next year.
For next year's festival, you could possibly add some foreign films, like  Chinese ones, which I like most.
We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometime later.
Maybe, technology will never stop advancing and our life will never work without computers.
I hope  to be a producer of shows, as soon as possible.
I CAN READ ALL THE NEWS AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS IN THE VIRTUAL NEWSPAPERS AND I CAN TALK WITH MY FOREIGN FRIENDS THANKS TO THE ICQ PROGRAM .
I HAD NEVER USED THE INTERNET BEFORE, BUT IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE.
For example, all infrastructure , such as public transport and power stations , are run using computers ,
the government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kinds of institutions and businesses , such as hospitals and supermarkets , use them as essential capitals.
There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference.
For me , as a scientist , it's a big problem to show how the innovations of the last century  went up with the environment and nature.
Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandals usually increase their fame, even if they do something wrong.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take.
I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourite ones.
Because of that, I  waited for a long time .
We had a brilliant night.
And last, at the end of the performance, we would have liked to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance.
I am really looking forward to going camping
I could feel every movement which was caused by  clouds or wind.
It is very good for us but I think we should think  more carefully when we buy something for our children.
I recently had the opportunity to see "over the rainbow" , which was performed last week in the Circle theatre.
First I would like to thank you for organising this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize.
In addition to this, we have chosen the luxury Palace Hotel , which is comfortable enough and in a good location.
Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broke, with a lot of bills to pay.
I had read  that it was a very enjoyable show!
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government 
However, I have to say that it has made people  lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic.
In spite of this, there are also make-up and hairstyles , which attract girls most.
I am writing this letter referring to the show "over the Rainbow" you put on on the 10 of this month.
There are a lot of interesting activities and that makes it hard to choose only two.
In my opinion, each human being has a right to be free.
She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always makes a joke of it . That makes me feel so embarrassed: I was very angry at that time!
In these galleries there are Historical paintings  and antique furniture which Chiang used.
I hope you will give me back the price of my ticket!
For example, now women don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing  dishes.
To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m ., it started at 8:15 p.m.
Modern technology createdhas created other conveniences:
I think  modern technology is very important in my life.
How many jeans, Pants, sweaters etc... do I have to take?
The only way they could move was using their feet.
The rules must be respected by all people if you don't want to getto be kicked out of school.
I really recommend you to help them, I think this is a good opportunity and I want you to understand my feeling well.
In the advertisement, it wrotesaid that the show was London's newest and best musical show.
This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who left her whole fortune to him.
I like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sound of the music was terrible.
The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classical music, which were fantastic.
I've heard that the Leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles are really wonderful.
For the activities I would like to choose the tennis , which I am not too bad at, and climbing, which I have never done but which must be interesting.
First thing is the computer.
We are always trying to have more things, which lead us to neglect our family, our future, and other things which are probably more important than a new perfume.
I was so impressed with the exhibitions at the festival that you organized.
Firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the Internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I found out  the truth.
I suggest you should go by train and get off at  Museum Station.
I am delighted to reply to give you more information about me since I have won such a nice prize.
Because  fashion has repeated many times in the circle.
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying clothes.
It's a very popular sport in our region (area) also, but I have never found time to do it.
Even if I could meet some friend,  I couldn't express my affection to them because we have different backgroundbackgrounds and our first languages were different.
It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you .
I think you should have a kindergarten .
In fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their children.
I shall have a look at the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen.
I was really pleased to receive  your letter.
furthermore I simply love water sports and their challenges.
Nobody informed me about that.
Then the show was supposed to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour late.
I came to that show only  to see him and when the actor appeared, it was another one.
Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned.
I will use some photographs to put on a website  that belongs to a magazine, which I had projected.
I spent some great days in Vienna where I had the chance to help at the Pearl JamPearl Jam concert.
I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and in the end we had a big fight about everything.
Furthermore because I like to live in contact with  nature.
If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take food and cook it with a microwave.
I moved away that year,  to a whole new place and a whole new school.
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time making intimate friendships with people around me.
However, since I was a child I have noticed that , except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought  me more disadvantages than advantages.
I am really happy to receive a letter about Camp California from you.
You wrote that the main actor would be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing.
steel or iron, which are used in our buildings they. They can make them stronger and hard to destroy.
Basically it's  free time for the students to look round here by themselves.
The inside of the castle is always dark , even in the daytime.
At the end of the conference you can dance and sing together.
I prefer this accommodation because I think it's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent, near them, than when you stay in a log cabin.
One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel wildlifenature more than if I stay in log cabins.
As a whole, I have to say that I got something completely different from what I had expected to get.
What kind of choice do I have to make
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in August to earn money and after that (from September to June) I go to university as usual.
I used this equipment during the concert , but I was so complicated system.
It means the Japanese are planning for the future home.
Lastly, for all these reasons my evening was horrible, and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible.
Now Kim, I will finish my letter but I promise  to write again as soon as possible . Maybe if I've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the ....
At  present,  technology develops rapidly.
My life wouldn't be the same  without this progress.
In winter, they used to burn some wood to keep warm .
"Computer" was a word that nobody knew the meaning of .
Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as an assistant from the beginning of August.
Thinking about the home of the future, first of all, nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies, which make house-keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for a convenient life.
I found that most of them suggested that four lessons should be filmed , which are as follow:
The advertised starting time is 19:30 .
I camewent to see the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' in the Circle Theatre.
First, I would like to travel in July only, because I have got a job and July is the only time I can have a vacation.
The other activity I would prefer is sailing.
I would like to travel 
It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time: herself and the housekeeper.
Yes my daily life has changed and it's a good thing.
I had expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing.
I got it two weeks ago at a concert, but although I've been to the doctor, I can't get over it !
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea  how popular it would be one day.
What about  fashion in 100 years?
I was very  nervous.
I want to do these two activities while I am at the camp: sailing and photography.
First, you asked about when I would like to travel and the only possible time for me is in July, because my company only gave me holiday time in this period.
After that we have to make sure that we explain about the relationship between teachers and students, showing the  times that we have been out together.
As I never did this in my whole life could you tell me if we have to make our own meals or can I find everything ready to eat there?
I was very hopeful that I was going to have a good time.
The statue is protected by  guards .
The guards will change every four hours.
Finally , I hope the information I've given is useful for you, and hope you can answer my questions A.S.A.P.
Thanking you in advance for your help, I look forward to hearing from you.
I am very pleased to know you decided to come to the " Second International Conference on Human Rights" which will be held at Albert Hall College on  25  June.
The stage was covered with all sorts of light and we made it look like a waterfall.
Marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to organise a surprise for her.
Apart from this, advanced computer technology allows me to contact anyone  the moment that I want to, while five years ago , when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters , which was a slower way to contact  people.
Those devices have made our life easier as old fridges had to be defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if you have forgotten to close the door!
All these activities which should be filmed  are part of our daily life at our school.
Another change in my life is that I use the Internet as a library when I write my course papers .
I came to see my favourite actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the actors whom I saw were other people.
You shouldn't go shopping when the shops are so busy because it's so annoying.
I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give you the details  which you would like to know.
Well, first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holiday here in Portugal.
I don't want to be so evil about school but  rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school.
You've asked me how the Leysin Rock Festival was, but I still cannot find the words to explain how fabulous and unexpected it was.
It would be great if you could reorganise this matter at your earliest convenience.
Finally, I would like to tell you that I am asking for my money back, because I had displeasedunpleasanta totally unpleasant evening, completely different from what you had announcedpromised in your advertisement.
Dear Ms Helen Ryan,
Everyone has had or will have one while shopping.
They are always suffering from the vengeance that Heathcliff is sworn to, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other characters have put him in.
Everything was ready and I was too.
Probably, you will agree  to put the London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of the Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday.
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner,  his friend, asked him if he was very happy about his present, the new gold watch, he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends.
LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAVE TO BRING SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS SO I CAN PREPARINGPREPAREPACK MY LUGGAGE , BRINGING ONLY THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHES.
First of all I would like to appreciatethank you for your generous award.
First of all , you said Danny Brook was in the play but a different actor was in the role.
But I'm really happy  that I had even a small role in helping people enjoy themselves.
I'd like to ask you some questions: is it necessary to bring any money to the Camp?
I went to London for a week of "pure holiday" , thinking I would have some fun going to see your musical show.
The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw on the tickets that there would be discounts given, but, they didn't give us discounts!
The restaurant was closed because of illness.. whose?
Firstly, I was very embarrassingembarrassed during the concert, but all the staff were very kind to me and Tom too.
Po Lin Temple is open to the public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday, and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday.
Another one is  how much money I have to bring.
I went to the Circle Theatre, three weeks ago, to see "Over the Rainbow", the musical show that was playing at the time.
Since then I have lived in Area 57, and this is my diary .
I got confused and was disappointed again.
I have heard that  Camp California is famous for surfing, so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time.
Thank you for your last letter .
I really envy your holiday in the sun.
It will play from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing.
I'd also like to get in touch with nature, and that will be a great way to do that.
First of all , I was attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who performed effectively that evening.
It could be the way  to avoid busy times or days . Do not take your child with you ; choose the right shop which has a car park.
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been  camping for years and enjoy it very much.
I had always wanted to swim with sharks.
Well they didn't accept  my £20 discount ticket . Why?
Talking of my work, I mostly had to prepare the concert stage with some fellows.
We had walked for three hours (my mother, my two brothers and I) through the humid and noisy jungle, looking forward to reaching a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family, old friends of ours, used to live.
By the way, on the 14th of March the LONDON Fashion Show and Leisure show will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall.
On the other hand, it usually takes a lot of time to get exactly what you want .
In particular, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore.
Furthermore, I am going to enter a competition next year.
If I have the chance, I want to help at a concert again.
Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor , Danny Brook , would act in the show.
Despite  having enough money , shopping is not always enjoyable , because I don't know which things I will buy in the future.
Your time has been stolen.
In this moment Pat wished that she  hadhad never been keen on knowing secrets!
I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school day, we should film the large number of sports activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm.
But Golf is an absolutely new trial.
It will let me get up  close to nature, and experience life in the wild.
To make matters worse, I had expected to get a discount on the ticket, but when I went to the ticket office, there was not any discount available.
Additionally, 15% of students answered that they want the presentation lesson to be filmed.
We also have the  Internet , with which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute.
SO, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND  ALL OR PART OF THE MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW.
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents.
I am therefore writing to request a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque by post for £20.
We suggest visiting the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus.
Also, may I take a friend with me ?
How much should she pay?
14, March, and is open from 10:00 to 19:00.
In my opinion, it is great that science and technology improve  our life.
Below I clarifyprovide some information you asked about.
There was no discount at all , which was in contrast with 'Discounts Available'.
I think that  is all that I would like to know.
I would highly recommend this building, because you cannot only enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors.
Of course in the beginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at it you'll also earn some money.
I also got to install new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
I hope you understand my complaints.
I had known that before but I thought that he might have changed.
As I was a champion in a swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practise my skills.
What is more, they insist that as well as celebrities, they are also human beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched.
I work with children and the computer helps me in my Jobjob but affectedaffects it too.
The show should have started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened.
I'm pleased to receive your letter and really happy that I won the first prize.
First of all, the poster told me that this show starredstarred Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there were different actors.
I know that I will need sports equipment such as  tennis shoes, a few sports shirts and shorts.
The show was called "Over the rainbow" and should be, reference toto quote the advertisement, London's newest and best musical show.
We asked Pat many times to keep this secret, not to tell anyone.
I am writing to complain about a musical show called 'Over the Rainbow ' that took place in the Circle Theatre.
 70% of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students  attending this lesson, are not only excited but also very active.
It would be nice to have a chance to try a new sport when we are relaxed.
It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and in a few minutes I can be on the other side of Lecce to play piano with my  band, then I can go back home when I want, listening to the news about what has happened around the world on my car radio.
In the past I was in a basketball team and I enjoyed it a lot.
I didn't want to play games outside with my friends .
I would like to sing and take photographs . I've done a course in photography and I think that I am very good at it.
To make matters worse, there were no discounts on tickets such as you advertised.
I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre seeing a musical show.
My summer holidays last for two months, but I only have time in July.
On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written in your programme.
The group needed to find a good microphone for the concert, because the singer lost his microphone last concert.
It goes oncontinues to develop and always will be the most important thing in our life.
I wished you could have been there with me.
But it is also  technology which tries to resolve this problem with new waysmeans of transport such as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities.
I wish you had been there and seen the concert,
I would like to know if it is necessary for me to bring some money, and if we will have time to visit the City .
About the clothes , do I have to bring some winter clothes?
As a director's assistant , my job was the organisation of the audience's seats and tickets.
I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's favourite activity.
I have been learning to paint.
I am also writing to ask for your permission to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be on Tuesday 14 March.
We have seen the programme  and we all think it will be enjoyable.
The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I receiveddid not receive an explanation why.
I am really glad  receivingto receive the first prize in your competition .
It will be very pleasant joining the holiday.
I was spending some days in London and liked the idea of seeing this show a lot.
The most exciting experience was that I could meet a lot of people.
As we all know, technology has improved gigantically over the last 20 years, and today, it affects us in many ways.
As  you can understand , I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money on a nonsense thing.
I am not satisfied with your show as it was completely different from the advertisement.
Should I take some clothes for the cold weather?
And it is even more difficult to predict what  clothes in the future will look like.
Thank you for asking about my latest good experience . I will let you know what the important details are.
I am so happy to have won the first prize in your competition.
What I decided to do was to get into the house by climbing on the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked.
First, I would like to travel in July, because I am a university student and I have only one month of summer vacation , that is in July.
The most important development is the Internet  , which is connected to the whole world's computers by  telephone lines.
There she died because  she did not have the Faerian food necessary for her survival.
All I could think was "Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking with and helping the most famous pop bands!"
It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity done on it.
It doesn't interfere with studying, does it?
We have just seen the advertisement for 'The London fashion and Leisure Show'.
We don't expect much bad to happen on our holiday, but this was  a perfect show as well,
it was the worst show and theatre I have ever been to in my life.
When I was at the Universityuniversity I was very keen on basketball and I played for the University'suniversity team.
I am writing to you first of all to thank you for the excellent programme that you have given us for the trip to London, especially for planning a visit to the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting.
After that she told me  that the man was the boy  who she had met.
On the other hand, you cannot rest for 2 weeks as some new inventions come out every day.
I would be pleased if you could give me some more information about the accommodation, and some advice about the clothing ( shawl) I should wear and how much money I should take with me.
Without the development of modern technology, it may take you several years to reach your destination.
I'd suggest you visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment.
On the last day we are going to have about three hours' free time.
That would never happen in my country I must say.
. I am glad to provide all the information
We have no experience but we would like to learn this game.
What does it mean , the word "shopping"?
Suddenly, the burglar alarm came on.
The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March from 10.00 to 19.00.
we have technologyhigh-tech equipment for cooking, for work, for study, well nearly for everything.
What day I cancan I start my trip?
Of course, if we had a pretty uniform like yours, we would wear it with pleasure.
After all that , they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets.
In addition, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started half an hour later, at 20:15.
When I go shopping I don't think about any problems I have.
Before I bought my ticket and made train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot of good reviews of that show and I thought it would be a great event to share with friends.
It is something very special . Its pavementceiling is made from many small pieces of wood . Its windows have  many colours .
I would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so I can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing I need to know  is the amount of money that I have to bring with me.
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS VARIED A CATEGORYTOO VARIED A CATEGORY.
I want to attend swimming and tennis courses.
How much money do I need and do I have to have it in cash or can I use a credit card ?
As for sailing, well, I haven't tried it before . That is why I want to have a go.
Even before you find a color you like or the right size of  trousers, you have been looking for it a long time, then it's gone!
I was exhausted when the concert finished .
Anyway it has been one of my best experiences and I'll remember it for ever.
Technology is being improved by human beings rapidlyis rapidly being improved.
When booking ana flight, we can just make a phone call to any agency, and get it done in one minute.
Also the amount of money I need to bring ( are there any shops).
Therefore, I would like to ask you  to refund me my entrance fee, as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement.
But from another point of view, it is silly to be earning money and not spending it as you want.
Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things in with them, like knives or scissors.
I hope you do not disappoint me on this point.
I would also choose an outdoor lesson , "training".
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you for organising this excellent programme, especially the Leisure show, which is very interesting to us.
So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to miss it.
Are necessary tabletsAre tablets necessary (for headache, insects)?
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre production of "Over The Rainbow".
I am really looking forward to this camp.
Moreover, one of the important things for us is that entrance  is free for students, because students are generally short of money.
It opens from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm
And said just be careful.
On the one hand there are the materials from which the PCs are made , on the other hand is the huge waste problem .

Although the bank robbers complained to Pat, he had said nothing to anybodyhadn't said anything to anybody.

First of all we thank you for the excellent programme and especially for the visit to the Science Museum on Tuesday 14th .
Regarding the London Fashion and Leisure Show we would be very excited to go because it's an extravagant and unusual show with leisure, sportswear and hairstyles.

Thank you very much for this opportunity .
I'd like to travel only in July, because, for the rest of the year, I'm working in a bank.

We will see   objects  become smaller.
At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommend it to other friends.
Danny Brook is one of my favourite actors and there appeared a different one.
I was not satisfied with the show at all because it was very different from the description your advertisement had given.
The show was meant to start at 19:30 and I arrived early, frightened of not finding a good place to see "my hero".
I'm not sure  what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too.

I would like to stay in log cabins because I have stayed in tents many times in my childhood.

Because she saw a golden fish who was smiling at her and talking to her.
We have already discussed it and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students are very keen on going.
The horrible thing about this is  I'm still in heaven, but going out with the wrong person, because Pat mixed the people with their names.
For activities , we should film sports lessons because we always do something new.
Pat has been studying in the same class with me  this year.
It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and there are no teachers .
It could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
As you know, I was there to help with the  running of the concert and there were a lot of different things to do.
The pop concert had ten pop bands.
It's not a problem that there was no more discount available - but that I had chosen it, because I'm  allowed.
First of all, as you  know, lots of technology has advanced in a few years.
Computers changed my daily routine because , when I was younger, I spent most of my days outside playing basketball but now  I just play on the computers all day.
entryEntry is free.
The party will be  in the Palace Hotel.
I enjoyed it very much and I think you had a great idea.
Unfortunately, modern technology has made  life for many people easier.

Because it is not complex, also we don't confuse.
But his nose moved quickly when the police showed him a picture of the bank robbers.

Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy  tickets and when I appeared in front of the ticket desk I found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real price weren't the same, the real price was much higher.
In my opinion, one of the best things about the last Festival was that there were not only concerts there.
For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as reading on paper.
Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we would have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday.
I received your letter this morning and I was very surprised by it.
She didn't study a lot but she knew all the important things.
Pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
The main advantage of modern technology is getting more information in a shorter time.
On the other hand, if there are more than 10 people, you can pay a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person.

Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant , which was recommended in the advertisement . However, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the staff vacation , which I thought was very unprofessional.
I was responsible for the advertisements and I also had to invite the "important people" from our government.
It was written in the advertisement that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunately it was closed.
For example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because they will create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of wasting time.
I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or on an excursion it isn't  the same if I sleep in a cabin.

Last month, I went to a pop concert with four bands playing.
It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell the teachers anything, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise.
Although it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more . It is very fashionable these days.
My work consisted of checking the tickets, seeing the number on them and taking  people to their seats.

The show started at 20.15 but actually it should have started at 19.30.
But how does it affect  my daily life?
Lastly, your theatre restaurant was already closed when the show finished, because the  beginningstart of the show was late.
Secondly, I want to stay in a log cabin.
What about the clothes of people  in a hundred years' time?
I think sleeping in a tent is more fun than other ways.
But for me it is better  when I go at the weekend because then I don't spend so much money because I think  before I have to queue for half an hour  to buy something!
Second, I prefer log cabins to tents.
Every aspect of my life is being constantly influenced by achievements of science and technology - health, work, household, interaction with other people, etc.

When I began  working in an Insurance Company, I had only an old writing machinetypewriter, which made a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with  because the switchesbuttons were hard on my small fingers.
Why did you put in the advertisement 'Discounts Available'?

I prefer to stay in a tent so I go camping every summer and am used to sleeping in tents.
As you need more information, I will answer all your questions with pleasure.
It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
First, I am afraid  I can only travel in July.
The next day, I went to school as usual and was agog at the large number of girls waiting for me around my locker.
In addition to this, today companies can do nothing without a computer.
- Funny plays and films to spend the break;
Another disappointing point was that I wanted to see Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show, but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him.
I look forward to meeting you soon.
People have seen in the last 10 years how different our clothes can become .
Finally, when it's for pleasure shopping is enjoyable, but most of the time it isn't enjoyable!
For example, I was born knowing that man has walked on the moon.
Regarding the activities , I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, and I expect the water to be  crystal clear.
I mean, it is too crowded,
you have to wait such a long time before you can pay, and most of the things are too expensive!
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
It seemed that all people, the audience, the band and the staff were delightful.
. In conclusion, on the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve it.
The show was meant to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided to have supper was closed, without anyone giving the reason.
That was very disappointeddisappointing.
Computers will play an important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because via the computer we will be able to buy whatever we want.
It becomes easier and easier to use the computer for everything.
This made me a little bit angry because I already had trouble  buying a ticket earlier: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available.
Hoping to hear from you.
I would also like to know how much money I can bring.
I haven't written a letter to you for ages.
With a computer , however, all this is done in a matter of seconds.

I couldn't believe  it!
Finally, the day of the concert came.
Firstly, most people can remember the sad story of "Princess Diana" .
She died in Paris a few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called " Paparazzi".
I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
It was so difficult for me because I had been really scared to stand on a high place since I was young.
But I feel the word  "International" was not really suitable; because you  only had six countries' stars and artists .
Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wear club clothes to it, as they are suitable for dancing.
Basically , modern technology has made our life more comfortable but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship, togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for the whole day.
I will be leaving university in a few months' time but it is in my plans to continue my studies at another university , trying to do a master's of two yearstwo year master's.
Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it .

We would like to ask you if there is any chance of getting our money back  or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience?
- Accommodation: a log cabinslog cabin would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California.

It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death.
To finish, I wonder if I need to bring some money or if everything has been already paid for and what kind of clothes should I bring?
Unfortunately, I noticed  a lot of inaccuraciesa lot of inaccuracies on the advertisement:
According to your advertisement, the stars were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE.

This building has a hundred floors and it takes  five minutes to go from the ground to the top in the elevator.
Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every area of our lives.
Here I should also mention the decor of our classrooms and the atmosphere in them.
I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not open after the show due to the shortage of food .
As the second activity I have chosen to take photos.
It might be possible that the fish-pattern catch onwill catch on in 100 years.
Also, nine people out of ten have a mobile phone in our society.

For these reasons, we would like to suggest you go to the show instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon.
We thoughtthink it  a great opportunity to touch a part of the latest cultures, which are concentrated and sharpened in London.
I will give you the information which you asked me for in your letter and also I will ask you some questions.

Well, this is an open question to anyone.
First of all , I think we have grown up with  technology.

I am afraid that July is the only possible month, because I am due to start work in August.
Could you give me half of my money back ?
First of all, we went to the ticket office to get the tickets.
Secondly, in some ways, it can educate young children.
For example, your advertisement said that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not there!
IN ADDITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET.
I would like also to have more information about the cost and what kind of clothes you suggest I should bring with me.
I would like to suggest to you how the programme could be changed.
I am really annoyed.
It was a very interesting experience for me.
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places.
On the other hand, despite the fact that technology makes things easier in our daily life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people.
All the people are there mostly on the same day because there are not a lot of other opportunities for shopping during the week for  workers.
Using a microwave oven or vacuum cleaner saves me a lot of time.
Although this situation might not be very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until  quiet, sad end.
All of the students agree  that shopping is not always enjoyable.

Finally, I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theatre to cheat  your customers.
I didn't have  great fun, so I ask for that money back.
There is not really anything that I would like to change, because, as you know, in France, there are not really strict rules like in China or other countries.
In conclusion, I believe that shopping only wastes time .
It was then  I read the advertisement for the show at your theatre and I decided to see it.
However, I will only be able to go to there in July 2001 because I have a job which is extremely busy work.
I think that a child does not like shopping because he often has to wait, and I prefer to play with friends like these.

I can sing  plenty of songs ,
I didn't have a perfect evening out and instead I had an awful evening out.
Neither thing agrees with what I read in your advertisement.
It would be a great opportunity because it's free for students.
Choosing two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing, a sport in which I have many years of experience, and surfing , despite not really having any experience.
I would like to know about whichwhat sort of clothes I have got to take?
I've been practisingdoing this sport for 5 years, so I'm quite good.

First of all, it is a great idea to have  this kind of festival.
and he added that he left Marine because her mother died two days after Marine's birth 
I hope you find my opinions useful.

I am able to meet my friends quickly on the Internet by just clicking the mouse.
Secondly, regarding the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much.
Can you believe my luck?
Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take as many nice photos as I can in the camp area.
First of all, it was written in the advertisement for the show  that  the main actor would be Danny Brook, but a different actor played in the show.
It could be a good , memorable thing for me.
Also, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose . For one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most . I and my friend used to win the first place in the school-wide match when we were at school.
Before the performance I led the spectators to their seats and then an instructor showed me how to lead the spotlights.
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how grateful I am.
I would like to go in July because it's the only month I can choose.
They will be synthetic clothes, I think , made of plastic or something similar."

Could you let me know what type of clothes I should bring with me ?
If it rains, you can take the 54 bus that stops in front of the college.
I wasn't expecting this prize because it is too good to be true.
For me adventure one of the bestthis adventure was one of the best.

I could not listen to one of my favourite classical  concerts, "La Moldava" by Smetana.
As I am an expert camper, I would prefer to be put up in a tent rather than in a log cabin.
Conclusion: I do think, however, that modern technology is essential for human beings nowadays.
In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert.
In school, we have lots of rules, especially in  class and some of them are quite strange.
I really enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, if not the greatest experience of my life.
In conclusion, I had an unforgettable time.
During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had a chance to see most of the performance . That was excellent.
I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's  next year.
In the next 100 years there will be no change in that but  fashion is going to develop in a special imaginative way.
See you and write to me soon.
After their visit to the Museum, they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the Tuscan Archipelago, and they could have a picnic on the beach.

It's a good chance for you to improve your English.
 manager of the theatre,
So, what are you waiting for?
 About young people, the decision to offer a reasonably priced weekend ticket is an excellent idea because it brings them into contact with  art.
I only put the speakers in the right places, or helped the engineers test the lights.
Thank you for the amazing information about the competition.
I really like sleeping in tents.
Because my parents did most of the work, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat.
I play basketball very well, although I have never taken part in important competitions; however, I am not very good at tennis, and I would like to improve .
In my opinion technology has made living easier, funniermore fun and more comfortable.
It has been a long time since the last time I wrote to you...
Secondly, as for the times of the performance, instead of 19.30 it  started at 20:15, which meant being stranded at the theatre for such a long time.
Of course these gadgets will do our hard housework but otherwise we will get lazy, we will lose the skills that we have now.
After a visit to the British Museum, you will certainly be able to put your history textbook away!
At first she walked around the bay-side market , looking at all the people who were there.
The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show on that date.
; when I go out, sometimes my parents are worried so they phone  me to see if everything is  alright.
It is such an evolution for the human race, however , we cannot forget that it can cause some problems too.
Last, if you have some free time hours, you should visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train.
About the activities while at the Camp , I would like to do swimming, not because I am good at it, just because I am keen on it and the other one is Photography.
This was not the worst thing because when I arrived at the theatre I waited forty fiveforty-five minutes because the show should start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15.
In conclusion, I don't want to change anything in my house or at school, because I totally agree with the few rules that I have.
Second, I prefer to stay in a log cabin.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and he usually made up some extra information.
In my opinion, you have to give us back our money because everything that you wrote in your advertisement was not true.
I spentI had one week's holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon.
So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the in our lives thingsthings that are really important in our lives.
Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit   the headmaster's head.
It is located in the middle of the forest.
Of course this is just because I am lazy, I actually could force myself a little, and then go to the library and to the post office, but the Internet just makes it easier!
The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there are many ways to get to the conference.
I am writing to you because I am really disappointed about "Over the Rainbow" which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized.
However, people have noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind.
Similarly, more than 100 years ago  people didn't have the light bulb.
It was a very exciting moment and a very nice competition.
So I must find  a way  to help my great father.
So I'd be happy to do the activities for two reasons.
Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for a discount but they weren't available.
His name is saul Hernañdez and he is very funny .
That night I had a lot of fun with them and of course I was in the first row at the concert.

One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very firmly to keep it a secret , especially from the other groups.
They told me Pat used to be a close friend of theirs and she used to talk about me and my problems.
How much money can I spend during this time?
As I have explained , it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back for the reasons that I mentioned above.
Why not shop over the Internet or if you have a nice mother at home enjoy this time because shopping is like going into the jungle.
Also there was another problem . I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not, it was closed because it was being refurbished and redecorated.
We had a lot of fun during our last holiday and we took a lot of pictures.
The respect of Famous people's private lives has always been a hot topic...
On the one hand, those people are like us in the way that they had a childhood, they got married and had a family...
According to your advertisement, the actor should have been Danny Brook, but in fact it was a different person.
If you could reply to my letter by the 28th of June I'd be grateful  because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company.
But it was closed because there was not anything to drink or to eat.
I think more and more people will have at least one flat ; it won't matter if you are rich or not.
Someone says it is maths  -  practical, useful  -  but the majority say it is boring, unless you're choosing a job which demands all your maths knowledge such as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer.
I was very disappointed because I didn't find what I was expecting at your show.
However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement for in this week's college newspaper.
Also, for all these attractions, the price was low and that is important for a big family.
You wrote that discounts were available but they were not available.
It said in the leaflet that this would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
I would prefer to stay in a cabin because I had some experience of tents in my childhood and it was not a very good experience , therefore I would like to stay in a cabin.
I look forward to hearing some news from you.
For instance, it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a T-shirt although you do not buy anything.
I went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone, so, I went to many shops just to get the same answer.
I am just writing to tell you about my experience  helping at a pop concert.
However, the one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all the events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money.
One good idea is to go  shopping  when you have got plenty of money.
Suddenly, a strong wind blew up  thousands and thousands of petals.
And at the time of the concert we wore  big funny costumes, and danced with people.
Nobody should be late in the morning because it is important to respect your matesclassmatesclassmates' and teachers' effort  to get up early.
Now I try to show, in my daily work, how the airborn chlororganics, which are derived from plastics, will be separated and damaged by green plants.
Meanwhile, these activities are developed.
I liked him a lot.
She was given a chance: if she was able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would start trusting her.
So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just found a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a small sign on a door: "Sorry, we are closed for renovations"!
It's the best thing you can do in this case.
But, I needed to tell it to someonetell someone about it, so I told Pat about it.
Or you may  get irritable!
I suggest you try this kind of experience.
Also I think that the dance shows should include different styles of dancing
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage, doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there.
We had to take  some clothes off her and then to put on other completely differentcompletely different ones  in just a few minutes (similar to Formula One).
I have always been interested in arts and festivals.
TO BE PART OF THE STAFF  WOULD BE WONDERFUL, I THOUGHT.
It will be a presentation of the latest fashions and of  leisure and sports wear.
Firstly, Danny Brook did not appear as you had promised.
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good at it, however , I hope that I can learn about it at the Camp.
And also I have never played the piano with  singers before, and  that  makes me more confident and has improved my skills a lot.
I would call our days  days of great technological progress.
He told me for two hours what could happen if I  did that.
I had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocaine using my cheques.
I would like to know if it is necessary for me to take some clothes with me for the sports activities?
I felt like a fool, and all the audience felt as I did.
The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the  staff and also every day I was  backstage supporting the catering staff.
I'd like to get to know the USA.
All those discos, concerts, and tourist trips have to be paid for with  different sums of those small coloured pieces of paper  called money
Obviously Ted should not have known anything about it and we reminded it to Patreminded Pat of that twice: " The party is a secret!!"
For music like jazz and rock , it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem .
But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so ashamed that I lowered my head.
Many times we buy things that , actually, we don't need and, sometimes you are surprised when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down on your expenses for 2 months.
Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop singers and bands whom we would be able to see!
Secondly, when the show started, I was looking for Danny Brook, because this actor was the most important reason for me to see the show.
- As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become awkward for me.
I also agree with you about the ticket's price.
The other events I went to, dance shows, art exhibitions and talks by writers, were well-organised and extremely interesting.
Otherwise they can have lots of problems and it is difficult to live.
First of all, I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote to me asking for my preferences about the Camp.

Three days later we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, " Oh Pat , don't tell us that lie again", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter.
Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot, I can even say it has changed it.
But the worst thing of all is that they are often the victim of malicious gossip, which most of the time is not even true.
Other bad points can be mentioned, like  pollution for example.
You will have a good time  shopping.

I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I saw last Sunday , in the evening.
I think we have to take into consideration our environmentour environment into consideration:  pollution makes the atmosphere warmer and warmer.
I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed with that evening.
But there was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go discosto discos alone, so I had to go illegally, and I decided I would do it.
The result  is we feel guilty after spending more than expectedwe expected, or even suffer from financial difficulty.
The show afterwards was great.
I'm sorry to tell you  that I'm really disappointed with your advertisement for the musical show at the Circle Theatre.
I will choose for my activities tennis and swimming . I'm good at tennis because I have played since 1990 and I love it and I chose swimming because I like to swim and I've been in two competitions and I won both.
I had to wait in the overcrowded hall.
It takes five minutes to get to my college on foot.
Finally, I had hoped that I could have  dinner in the restaurant after the show, but, to make me totally disappointed, it was closed, and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00.
Sometimes there are so many people that you have to wait half an hour to get a computer.

I thanked my new friends for not telling anybody my secrets even though before the trouble we weren't very close friends.
In the future we can expect to have a new material and it will make our life more comfortable and convenient.
It was a Jaguar with Will Smith in it . I stopped and I was going to ask if he needed some help and he said , "Of course".

But after they separated, he told his friends her secrets without thinking.
Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes in the advertisement, before the start of the show.
I would like to inform you that the idea was great and I hope that such necessary events will become a good tradition in our country.
I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologisesapologised  thousands of times.

But, when they heard a scream, they stopped and, when they saw a shadow coming toward them, they started running, hearing a voice saying: "Our secret!"
In addition to this, I could not get a cheaper ticket so I wonder why the advertisement mentioned  the discount on tickets.
Because of all these circumstances , we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint.
Moreover, with computer networks, it is possible for people to work from home, making projects, controlling operations or having conferences.
Despite the huge advantages , technology has affected our lives negatively.
Secondly for us there are  disadvantages because  pollution affects us indirectly, and because I don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
Instead, you changed the actor without any warning, so I didn't see my favourite Danny Brook, which was a  total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't match him at all.
It would be nice of you if you could refund us some money or send us two new tickets.
And their life passed by their eyes.
