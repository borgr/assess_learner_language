Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
More people ( relatives ) know her problem , and a greater information channel is provided .
The problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power.
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media.

My answer is no .
We do not consider much about our offspring.
Then, his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
Second, the shortage in the workforce can also endanger the development of society.
It is the advance of surveillance technology.
Actually, tracking systems have provided people safety indemnification.

However, as life expectancy rises, some social challenges occur as well.
Here, red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away .
Actually, tracking systems have provided people safety indemnification.
RFID is also functional at police events.
