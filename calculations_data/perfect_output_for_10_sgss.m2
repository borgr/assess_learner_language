Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Today, surveillance technology is everywhere around us
With the development of the modern society, people live longer.
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
With the development of the modern society, people live longer.
However, an ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it.
Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure.
My answer is no .
First, rising life expectancy could cause resource challenges.
