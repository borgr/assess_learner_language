Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
However, aging population is a phenomenon opposite to it.
Students can exchange their experiences in study even if they are in different countries.
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
